    'Episodes Summary': '<p>The applications that demand deep learning range from self-driving cars to healthcare, but the way that models are developed and trained is similar. A model is trained in the cloud and deployed to a device. The device engages with the real world, gathering more data. That data is sent back to the cloud, where it can improve the model.</p><p>From the processor level to the software frameworks at the top of the stack, the impact of deep learning is so significant that it is driving changes everywhere. At the hardware level, new chips are being designed to perform the matrix calculations at the heart of a neural net. At the software level, programmers are empowered by new frameworks like Neon and TensorFlow. In between the programmer and the hardware, middleware can transform software models into representations that can execute with better performance.</p><p>Milena Marinova is the senior director of AI solutions at the Intel AI products group, and joins the show today to talk about modern applications of machine learning and how those translate into Intel’s business strategy around hardware, software, and cloud.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>This episode is a republication from my interview with <a href="http://www.se-radio.net/2014/04/episode-203-leslie-lamport-on-distributed-systems/">Leslie Lamport on Software Engineering Radio.</a></p><p>Leslie Lamport won a Turing Award in 2013 for his work in distributed and concurrent systems. He also designed the document preparation tool LaTex. Leslie is employed by Microsoft Research, and has recently been working with TLA+, a language that is useful for specifying concurrent systems from a high level.</p><p>The interview begins with a definition: a distributed system is a multiprocessor system in which the time required for interprocess communication is large compared to the time for events within a single processor–in other words, it takes longer for interprocess communication than it does for a process to look at its own memory.</p><p>Alternatively, a distributed system is one in which processors communicate by sending messages. Leslie goes on to talk about how he became interested in distributed systems, and describes the story behind his paper about the Paxos algorithm. The goal of Paxos is to maintain consensus in an environment with unexpected faults (otherwise known as Byzantine faults). After the discussion of Paxos, Jeff asks Leslie about his recent talk “Thinking for Programmers,” which emphasizes the benefit of having a specification prior to writing actual code. “Specification” can mean a variety of things, but predicates and next-state relationships provide a mathematical rigor that is well-suited to distributed and concurrent systems. The conversation concludes with Jeff asking Leslie about how a programmer can build the mental resolve to work through a difficult problem.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Cloud computing changed the economics of running a software company. </p><p>A cloud is a network of data centers that offers compute resources to developers. In the 1990s, software companies purchased servers–an upfront capital expense that required tens of thousands of dollars. In the early 2000s, cloud computing started, and turned that capital expense into an operational expense. </p><p>Instead of a huge bulk purchase of servers, a software developer can pay as they go–which is so much easier on the budget than the bulk purchase. This transformation of capital expense to operational expense significantly lowered the barrier to entry to starting software companies: cloud computing created an economic boom that continues to today, and shows no signs of slowing down.</p><p>Of course, the upfront capital expense did not disappear. It got aggregated into the cloud providers. Instead of individual software companies buying servers like they did in the 90’s, cloud providers buy thousands of servers and build data centers around the world. Because the of the aggregation, cloud providers get economies of scale–it is much cheaper for a single cloud provider to buy 1000 servers than for 1000 software companies to buy 1 server.</p><p>The first wave of cloud computing was all about deploying our applications to servers that run in cloud data centers. The next wave of cloud computing is moving more and more of our application logic into managed services.</p><p>In the first wave of cloud computing, we had to spin up a server to run our database. We needed a server for our search engine, and our load balancer. The logical unit of a server comes with the risk that the server will crash, or will be hacked, or will develop a bug that is difficult to solve.</p><p>Managed services abstract away the notion of a server. Database-as-a-service, search-as-a-service, load balancing-as-a-service; these services are reliable lego blocks that we can build entire applications out of. Developers pay a premium for a managed service–but they are happy to pay that premium because it represents a promise that this service will not crash, will not be hacked due to a software vulnerability, and will not develop bugs that are the responsibility of the developer.</p><p>Developers are very happy to pay higher unit prices for these managed services than they pay for raw servers. And cloud providers are very happy to develop these managed services–because it turns the infrastructure-as-a-service business into a software-as-a-service business. Software-as-a-service has better margins, better retention, and better competitive differentiation than infrastructure-as-a-service.</p><p>As a developer, I’m looking forward to building applications completely out of specialized managed services. But we are still pretty far from that time. </p><p>Today, developers still need to write their own application logic and their own backend services. But there are a set of tools that allow developers to write their own services while getting some of the resiliency and scalability of managed services. These tools are functions as a service and Kubernetes.</p><p>Functions as a service let developers deploy stateless application logic that is cheap and scalable. Functions as a service still have some problems to overcome in the areas state management, function composition, usability, and developer education.</p><p>Kubernetes is a tool for managing containerized infrastructure. Developers put their apps into containers on Kubernetes, and Kubernetes provides a control plane for deployment, scalability, load balancing, and monitoring. So–all of the things that you would want out of a managed service become much easier when you put applications into Kubernetes.</p><p>This is why Kubernetes has become so popular–and it is why Kubernetes itself is being offered as a managed service by many cloud providers–including IBM. </p><p>For the last decade, IBM has been building out its cloud offerings–and for two of those years, Jason McGee has been CTO of IBM Cloud Platform. In this episode, Jason discusses what it is like to build and manage a cloud, from operations to economics to engineering.</p><p>If you like this episode, we have done many other shows about engineering cloud services at Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Digital Ocean.

Individuals who do not have a background in computer science or programming can create increasingly complex tools.</p><p>Higher level APIs include Twilio for managing phone communications, and Stripe for managing financial workflows. Platforms such as Shopify can be used as the core system for building an e-commerce business. Low-code tools such as Wix can be used for building web sites.</p><p>Monday.com was started in 2012 with the goal of making software for managing business workflows. Business workflows link together different teams and processes within a company. Monday allows non-engineers to automate workflows that are traditionally automated by engineers. For example, Monday can be used to build workflows that link together SalesForce and Twilio, or to trigger actions in MailChimp based on how a user interacted with a Shopify web site.</p><p>One of the biggest developing trends in technology is how non-engineers are becoming empowered to have more impact within an organization. The advances in these kinds of tools present us with an opportunity to rethink team structures, and invent entirely new roles for a software company.</p><p>Eran Zinman is the CTO and co-founder of Monday.com and he joins the show to describe the vision for Monday and how the product fits into the changing enterprise software trends around APIs and “low code” tools. </p><p>Monday has grown exponentially over the last 7 years, with the most recent growth curve looking almost vertical.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Military force is powered by software.</p><p>The drones that are used to kill suspected terrorists can identify those terrorists using the same computer vision tools that are used to identify who is in an Instagram picture. Nuclear facilities in Iran were physically disabled by the military-sponsored Stuxnet virus. National intelligence data is collected and processed using the MapReduce algorithm.</p><p>The military keeps up with technology more effectively than lawmakers. It is common to read a quote from a senator or a judge that shows a basic misunderstanding of cybersecurity. Many politicians do not even use email.</p><p>There is a large and growing knowledge gap between military capability and the technological savvy of policymakers. On the whole, government is not prepared for modern warfare.</p><p>We are lucky that military conflict in 2017 is decentralized.</p><p>There are small skirmishes in the Middle East, but there is nothing compared to the centralized hostility of World War II. The bonds of international trade form some protection against a war between major powers like US and China.</p><p>But it is easy to imagine circumstances that could lead global war. There is an arms race between the United States and China—and this arms race is happening in an environment of increasing informational chaos.<br>\nThis informational chaos stretches from the highest levels of government to the least informed of our citizenry.</p><p>Online journalism is becoming physically dangerous. Journalists are being tracked and threatened. Locations where journalists live have been published by enemies of those journalists. And this war on journalists has a chilling effect on the production of truthful information.</p><p>In the war between truth and false information, the people promoting false information have a giant advantage. And that advantage is growing because we cannot identify who is a bot and who is a human.</p><p>Social media creates a fog of war around information.</p><p>There is also a fog of war around real world physical conflict that is enacted remotely through computers. This type of confusion is the problem known as cybersecurity attribution.</p><p>When a power grid gets knocked offline by a hacker, how do we know who was responsible? When a drone flies through New York City shooting at people, how do we know who deployed that drone? When self-driving car technology becomes open source, how long will it be before we see a 9/11-type event performed remotely with cars instead of an airplane—and when it does happen, how will we respond?</p><p>Imagine the level of grief and anger on 9/11 that caused our government to launch a war on Iraq. Whether or not you supported that war, we were at least (sort of) aiming in the right direction of the geographic location where the attackers came from.</p><p>What would we do if could not figure out who launched such an attack?</p><p>When cyber forensics teams look into a problem, it might appear that an attack came from China at one layer, Russia from another layer, and some domestic attacker at another layer. It can be time consuming to uncover the truth behind a cyberattack.</p><p>Just like in social media information wars, the instigators of conflict have an advantage.</p><p>And the ability to instigate such a conflict is democratized. Social media, open source software, and cloud computing give a technologist superpowers. Cryptocurrencies can anonymize the financial transactions to pay for such tools, and basic encryption can anonymize the terroristic acts that occur over a remote internet connection.</p><p>Peter Warren Singer is a political scientist who formerly worked in the United States advisory committee on International Communications and Information Policy. He is also an author, whose books include <em>Wired for War, Cybersecurity and Cyberwar: What Everyone Needs to Know</em>, and <em>Ghost Fleet: A Novel of the Next World War</em>. Peter writes about the circumstances that could lead to global warfare, and how military actors might behave in a third world war.</p><p>In this episode, Peter shares a dark, but realistic vision that we should all hope to avoid.</p><p>If you like this episode, we have done many other shows on related topics–including drones, IoT security, and automotive cybersecurity.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>A hedge fund is a collection of investors that make bets on the future. The “hedge” refers to the fact that the investors often try to diversify their strategies so that the direction of their bets are less correlated, and they can be successful in a variety of future scenarios. Engineering-focused hedge funds have used what might be called “machine learning” for a long time to predict what will happen in the future.</p><p>Numerai is a hedge fund that crowdsources its investment strategies by allowing anyone to train models against Numerai’s data. A model that succeeds in a simulated environment will be adopted by Numerai and used within its real money portfolio. The engineers who create the models are rewarded in proportion to how well the models perform.</p><p>Xander Dunn is a software engineer at Numerai and in this episode he explains what a hedge fund is, why the traditional strategies are not optimal, and how Numerai creates the right incentive structure to crowdsource market intelligence. This interview was fun and thought provoking–Numerai is one of those companies that makes me very excited about the future.</p>',

Daniel Green is one of the founders of CamelCamelCamel, and he joins the show to describe his experience building the product.</p><p>Amazon and CamelCamelCamel (C3) have a complex relationship. C3 makes its money from referral listings. When a user tracks the price of an Amazon item using C3, that user will probably eventually click on the referral listing on C3. If the user purchases the item on Amazon, C3 gets a percentage of the purchase from Amazon.</p><p>C3 has millions of product listings where they are tracking the price of items on Amazon. They have created a directory with a large subset of Amazon’s items by leveraging an API that was originally meant for advertising. Whether or not this is a proper use of the API, C3 arguably leads to more purchasing volume on Amazon–which is ostensibly why Amazon lets the company continue to operate.</p><p>In today’s show, Daniel gives a history of CamelCamelCamel, including his own background as an engineer working in finance and how he wound up working on C3 for the past decade. We also talk through how C3 is architected.</p><p>RECENT UPDATES:</p><p><a href="http://findcollabs.com/open">The FindCollabs Open has started.

Sometimes, when I am lying in bed trying to get to sleep, I will ask my nearest device to read me a Wikipedia article.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p><em>Originally published June 7, 2018</em></p><p>Moore’s Law states that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles about every two years. Moore’s Law is less like a “law” and more like an observation or a prediction.</p><p>Moore’s Law is ending. We can no longer fit an increasing amount of transistors in the same amount of space with a highly predictable rate. Dennard scaling is also coming to an end. Dennard scaling is the observation that as transistors get smaller, the power density stays constant.</p><p>These changes in hardware trends have downstream effects for software engineers. Most importantly–power consumption becomes much more important. </p><p>As a software engineer, how does power consumption affect you? It means that inefficient software will either run more slowly or cost more money relative to our expectations in the past. Whereas software engineers writing code 15 years ago could comfortably project that their code would get significantly cheaper to run over time due to hardware advances, the story is more complicated today.</p><p>Why is Moore’s Law ending? And what kinds of predictable advances in technology can we still expect?</p><p>John Hennessy is the chairman of Alphabet. In 2017, he won a Turing award (along with David Patterson) for his work on the RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Compiler) architecture. From 2000 to 2016, he was the president of Stanford University.</p><p>John joins the show to explore the future of computing. While we may not have the predictable benefits of Moore’s Law and Dennard scaling, we now have machine learning. It is hard to plot the advances of machine learning on any one chart (as we explored <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/06/04/openai-compute-and-safety-with-dario-amodei/">in a recent episode with OpenAI</a>). But we can say empirically that machine learning is working quite well in production.</p><p>If machine learning offers us such strong advances in computing, how can we change our hardware design process to make machine learning more efficient?</p><p>As machine learning training workloads eat up more resources in a data center, engineers are developing domain specific chips which are optimized for those machine learning workloads. The Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) from Google is one such example. John mentioned that chips could become even more specialized within the domain of machine learning. You could imagine a chip that is specifically designed for a LSTM machine learning model.</p><p>There are other domains where we could see specialized chips–drones, self-driving cars, wearable computers. In this episode, John describes his perspective on the future of computing, and offers some framework for how engineers can adapt to that future.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Most user interfaces that we interact with are not animated. We click on a button, and a form blinks into view. We click a link and the page abruptly changes. </p><p>On the other hand, when we interact with an application that has animations, we can feel the difference. The animations are often subtle. If you aren’t sure what I’m talking about, pay attention the next time you use Slack or Facebook Messenger or iMessage. Airbnb values animation so much that they built Lottie, a library for animation. </p><p>In an animated application, the user interface feels alive. When a software team takes the time to build animations into small interactions, the user perceives the animations as polish and attention to detail. </p><p>Sarah Drasner has been evangelizing the value of animations for years, and she is an expert at implementing complex and beautiful animations on the web. She works at Microsoft as a developer advocate and joins the show to talk about how to build animations. If you are building a web application and want to create a unique UI, you might find this show useful.</p><p>JavaScript supports detailed animations, often through the manipulation of SVG files. SVG stands for “scalable vector graphics” a file format that represents an image in its own DOM. SVG is so flexible because of this DOM format, which defines the different parts of the SVG. This is in contrast to a bitmap, which is just a simple matrix of dots, without any rich metadata.</p><p>You could manipulate SVG with raw JavaScript—but most people use a frontend JavaScript framework like React, Angular, or VueJS. Sarah has been implementing most of her recent web animations using Vue, and she is a member of the Vue core team.</p><p>Vue has an entertaining story, because it gained popularity in a time when Google was supporting AngularJS and Facebook was supporting ReactJS. The first version of Vue was created from scratch by a single developer, Evan You. </p><p>If you are a Vue developer looking for an open source project to hack on, you can check out softwaredaily.com, which is an open source platform to consume content about software.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Cloud computing has been popular for less than twenty years. Large software companies have existed for much longer. If your company was started before the cloud became popular, you probably have a large, data center on your companies premises. The shorthand term for this software environment is “on-prem”.</p><p>Deploying software to your own on-prem servers can be significantly different than deploying to remote servers in the cloud. In the cloud, servers and resources are more standardized. It is often easier to find documentation and best practices for how to use cloud services.</p><p>Many of the software vendors who got started in the last decade created their software in the cloud. For example, <a href="https://readme.io/">Readme.io</a> makes it easy for companies to create hosted documentation. Their early customers were startups and other cloud-native companies. All of those companies were happy to consume the software in the cloud. As time went on, Readme found that other customers wanted to use the Readme product as a self-hosted, on-prem service. Readme needed to figure out how to deploy their software easily to the “on-prem” environment.</p><p>It turns out that this is a common problem. Software vendors who want to sell to on-prem enterprises must have a defined strategy for making those deployments to on-prem infrastructure–and those deployments are not always easy to configure. </p><p><a href="http://replicated.com">Replicated</a> is a company that allows cloud-based software to easily deploy to on-prem infrastructure. Grant Miller is the founder of Replicated and he joins the show to discuss on-prem, cloud, and the changing adoption patterns of enterprise software companies.</p>',

For serious workloads, enterprises chose Amazon almost unanimously. This phenomenon of Amazon as the default was described by a phrase that harkened back to the days of IBM’s dominance: “nobody ever got fired for choosing AWS.”</p><p>With the rise of Kubernetes, Google has established a reputation as a reliable provider of container orchestration. As enterprises look to roll out Kubernetes workloads, Google is convincing many of them to work with Google Kubernetes Engine.</p><p>Kubernetes is one part of the changes which fall under the description of “digital transformation”. As these enterprises build out their digital transformation strategy, they are also looking for a strategy around multicloud, on-prem, policy management, and consulting partnerships. </p><p>Anthos is a platform where enterprises manage the resources and configuration of their cloud deployments, as well as a system to partner with services integrators and independent software vendors.</p><p>Aparna Sinha works on Anthos, Google Kubernetes Engine, and other projects at Google. In today’s show we discuss the process of digital transformation, as well as the tactics for how a digital transformation is actually implemented. We also talked about GKE on-prem, and the kinds of tooling needed by on-prem application deployments.</p>',

When a customer orders from a restaurant, DoorDash needs to identify the ideal driver for picking up the order from the restaurant and dropping it off with the customer.</p><p>This process of matching an order to a driver takes in many different factors. Let’s say I order spaghetti from an Italian restaurant. How long does the spaghetti take to prepare? How much traffic is there in different areas of the city? Who are the different drivers who could potentially pick the spaghetti up? Are there other orders near the Italian restaurant, that we could co-schedule the spaghetti delivery with?</p><p>In order to perform this matching of drivers and orders, DoorDash builds machine learning models that take into account historical data. In today’s episode, Raghav Ramesh explains how DoorDash’s data platform works, and how that data is used to build machine learning models. We also explore the machine learning model release process—which involves backtesting, shadowing, and gradual rollout.</p>',

At both of these companies, the customer base was at a massive scale. </p><p>At Dropbox, Tammy worked on the database that holds metadata used by Dropbox users to access their files. To call this metadata system simply a “database” is an understatement–it is actually a multi-tiered system of caches and databases. This metadata is extremely sensitive–this is metadata that tells you where the objects across Dropbox are located–so it has to be highly available. </p><p>To encourage that reliability, Tammy helped institute chaos engineering–inducing random failures across the Dropbox infrastructure, and making sure that the Dropbox systems could automatically respond to those failures.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Software engineering is an art and a science. To manage engineers is to manage artists and scientists.</p><p>Software companies build practical tools like payment systems, messaging products, and search engines. Software tools are the underpinnings of our modern lives. You might expect this core infrastructure which modern humans rely on to have been constructed with pure formulaic rigor. </p><p>But the best software tools are not built within a totally defined process. Software is built through messy iteration. When a piece of software looks pristine, that is often a function of how many mistakes have been made, and then subsequently corrected for.</p><p>There is no fixed process for how to build good software. </p><p>As our tools get better, we have to update our software engineering practices to utilize those new tools. We have to rethink the style that we are working in. We have to discard old tools and procedures in order to pick up the new ones, and have higher leverage.</p><p>As an organization scales, the structure of the organization needs to be modified. Team members need to be reallocated. Checks and balances need to be put in place. Rules and cultural practices need to codified, because a larger organization cannot have ties broken by an individual.</p><p>Software is built by humans, and every management decision must be considered in the light of human psychology. When we change a line of code, the code does not get emotional about being altered. But the same cannot be said of humans.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Evolutionary algorithms can generate surprising, effective solutions to our problems. </p><p>Evolutionary algorithms are often let loose within a simulated environment. The algorithm is given a function to optimize for, and the engineers expect that algorithm to evolve a solution that optimizes for the objective function given the constraints of the simulated environment. But sometimes these results are not exactly what we are looking for.</p><p>For example, imagine an evolutionary algorithm that tries to evolve a creature that do a flip within a simulated physics engine that mirrors the real world. </p><p>You could imagine all sorts of evolutionary traits. Maybe the creature will evolve to have legs that are like springs, and let the creature jump high enough to do a flip. Maybe the creature will develop normal legs with strong muscles that propel the creature high enough to flip. But you wouldn’t expect the creature to evolve to be extremely tall–so tall that the creature can merely lean over fast enough so that the top of its body flips upside down. In one experiment, this is exactly what happened.</p><p>In another, similar experiment, the evolving creature discovered a bug in the physics engine of the simulated environment. This creature was able to exploit the problem with this physics engine to be able to move in ways that would not be possible in our real-world physical universe.</p><p>Evolutionary algorithms sometimes evolve solutions in ways that we don’t expect. Researchers usually throw those results away, because they don’t contribute to the result that the researchers are looking for. The consequence is that lots of interesting anecdotes get lost.</p><p>Joel Lehman, Dusan Misevic, and Jeff Clune are the lead authors of the paper “The Surprising Creativity of Digital Evolution.” The paper was a collection of anecdotes about strange results within the world of digital evolution. They join the show to describe what digital evolution is, and some of the strange results that they surveyed in their paper.</p><p>Joel and Jeff are engineers at Uber’s artificial intelligence division–so this topic has applicable importance to them.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>As the gig economy grows, that growth necessitates innovations in the online infrastructure powering these new labor markets. </p><p>In our previous episodes about <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/tag/uber/">Uber</a>, we explored the systems that balance server load and gather geospacial data. In our coverage of <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/tag/lyft/">Lyft</a>, we studied Envoy, the service proxy that standardizes communications and load balancing among services. In <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/tag/airbnb/">shows about Airbnb</a>, we talked about the data engineering pipeline that powers economic calculations, user studies, and everything else that requires a MapReduce.</p><p>In today’s episode, we explore the business and engineering behind another online labor platform: Fiverr. </p><p>Fiverr is a marketplace for digital services. On Fiverr, I have purchased podcast editing, logo creation, music lyrics, videos, and sales leads. I have found people who will work for cheap, and quickly finish a job to my exact specification. I have discovered visual artists who worked with me to craft a music video for a song I wrote.</p><p>Workers on Fiverr post “gigs”–jobs that they can perform. Most of the workers on Fiverr specialize in knowledge work, like proofreading or gathering sales leads. The workers are all over the world. I have worked with people from Germany, the Philippines, and Africa through Fiverr.</p><p>Fiverr has become the leader in digital freelancing. The staggering growth of Fiverr’s marketplace has put the company in a position similar to an early Amazon. There is room for strategic expansion, but there is also an urgency to improve the infrastructure and secure the market lead.</p><p>Gil Scheinfeld is the CTO at Fiverr, and he joins the show to explain how the teams at Fiverr are organized to fulfill the two goals of strategic, creative growth and continuous improvement to the platform.</p><p>One engineering topic we discussed at length was event sourcing. Event sourcing is a pattern for modeling each change to your application as an event. Each event is placed on a pub/sub messaging queue, and made available to the different systems within your company. Event sourcing creates a centralized place to listen to all of the changes that are occurring within your company. </p><p>For example, you might be working on a service that allows a customer to make a payment to a worker. The payment becomes an event. Several different systems might want to listen for that event. Fiverr needs to call out to a credit card processing system. Fiverr also needs to send an email to the worker, to let them know they have been paid. Fiverr ALSO needs to update internal accounting records.</p><p>Event sourcing is useful because the creator of the event is decoupled from all of the downstream consumers. As the platform engineering team works to build out event sourcing, communications between different service owners will become more efficient.</p><p>Transcript provided by We Edit Podcasts.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Ethereum allows developers to run decentralized applications. But the tooling for building and managing those decentralized applications is immature. Experienced software engineers have difficulty getting started with writing Ethereum applications because the stack of tools is so unfamiliar and different than traditional software tools.</p><p>Whether or not Ethereum itself succeeds, developers in the future will probably be building some decentralized apps. We will be treating money as a first-class citizen and architecting software that transfers financial value as easily as we transmit JavaScript today. “Web3” will be a world in which many more software applications will be possible.</p><p>As we move towards Web3, many new tools will be built. Web2 was the result of Ruby on Rails, Amazon Web Services, the iPhone, and other software tools that made it easier to deploy web servers and consume Internet services. In the world of Web2, we saw the birth of Airbnb, Uber, and Netflix. In the world of Web3, we will see new types of gig economy apps, sharing economy platforms, and social networks. These new applications will arrive gradually as the tooling improves, and makes it easier for developers to hack together businesses and side projects built on cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Brian Soule is the founder or Ethsimple, a company that makes tools for Ethereum developers. Brian joins the show to talk about the state of cryptocurrencies, the tooling that developers have access to, and his company Ethsimple.</p><p>We cover high-level ideas, such as Bitcoin maximalism and also talk about some more technical areas of the Ethereum ecosystem, such as the Ethereum Name Service.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Software gives us new ways of communicating with each other. Engineers build scalable systems for e-commerce, helpdesk, and video sharing–and these systems do scale, to millions of people. But software alone cannot serve all of the demands of all the users and customers on these platforms. </p><p>We need customer service representatives to address unexpected demands. We need design specialists to evaluate the interface that made sense to the engineers but not the users. We need sales people to connect our strange software to an impatient prospective customer.</p><p>Engineers sometimes joke about firing all the non-engineers in the company. As engineers, it is easy to discount all of the work that non-engineers do–it can seem unscalable, or non-quantifiable, or mechanical. But most companies would fall over immediately without support, sales, design, operations, and the multitude of other non-engineering roles. </p><p>More to the point–people in non-technical roles can drive the success of an en organization. Some of the most influential leaders in tech came from a non-technical background: Stuart Butterfield of Slack; Brian Chesky of Airbnb; Sheryl Sandberg of Google and Facebook. A liberal arts education can foster the perfect set of skills to thrive in a technology company.</p><p>George Anders is an author whose most recent book is called <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/You-Can-Anything-Surprising-Education/dp/0316548804">You Can Do Anything: The Surprising Power of a “Useless” Liberal Arts Education</a></em>. George is one of my favorite business writers, and some of his past writing includes pieces about Sequoia Capital, Amazon, Linkedin, and a ton of other topics on Quora.</p><p>If you like this episode, we have done many other shows about business with guests like Seth Godin and Tyler Cowen–indeed many of the shows on Software Engineering Daily are not deeply technical.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Engineers who start companies often find themselves building something they have no experience with: a hiring process.</p><p>Hiring engineers today is not as systematic as building software. We don’t have lots of data that tells us what makes for an effective programming interview question. The smartest tech companies in the world are still making hiring mistakes–often through the “false negative” of rejecting candidates who did not do well in their interview process or through the “false positive” of hiring candidates who did well in the interview, but were not a good fit for the job.</p><p>If you are a hiring manager or a company founder, you will eventually have to build a hiring process. If you don’t treat that hiring process scientifically, you will likely make some mistakes.</p><p>Ammon Bartram has conducted more than 1000 interviews with engineers, accumulating a vast amount of data. This data was gathered deliberately and scientifically, through closely tracked interview questions and a consistent end-to-end process for the job candidate. Ammon joins the show to talk about the data set he has accumulated, the conclusions from all of these interviews, and how engineering organizations can use this data to develop a smart, data-driven hiring process.</p><p>Ammon is co-founder of Triplebyte, a company that helps match engineers and tech companies. Triplebyte also publishes lots of research and blog articles about <a href="https://triplebyte.com/blog/how-to-interview-engineers">conducting good interviews</a>, <a href="https://triplebyte.com/blog/does-it-make-sense-for-programmers-to-move-to-the-bay-area">developer salaries</a>, and <a href="https://triplebyte.com/blog/bootcamps-vs-college">bootcamps vs. computer science degrees</a>.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Cloud providers created the ability for developers to easily deploy their applications to servers on data centers. In the early days of the cloud, most of the code that a developer wrote for their application could run on any cloud provider, whether it was Amazon, Google, or Microsoft. These cloud providers were giving developers the same Linux server that they would expect from an on-premise deployment.</p><p><a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2017/11/07/netflix-serverless-like-platform-with-vasanth-asokan/">Early cloud applications such as Netflix</a>, <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2016/03/08/data-engineering-airbnb-maxime-beauchemin/">Airbnb</a>, and <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/11/01/ubers-big-data-platform-100-petabytes-with-minute-latency/">Uber</a> took advantage of this cloud infrastructure to quickly scale their businesses. In the process, these companies had to figure out how to manage open source distributed systems tools such as Hadoop and Kafka. Cloud servers were easy to create, but orchestrating them together to build distributed systems was still very hard.</p><p>As the cloud providers matured, they developed higher level systems that solved many of the painful infrastructure problems. Managed databases, autoscaling queueing systems, machine learning APIs, and hundreds of other tools. Examples include Amazon Kinesis and Google BigQuery. These tools are invaluable because they allow a developer to quickly build applications on top of durable, resilient cloud infrastructure.</p><p>With all of these managed services, developers are spending less time on infrastructure and more time on business logic. But managed services also lead to a new infrastructure problem—how do you manage resources across multiple clouds?</p><p>A bucket storage system like Amazon S3 has different APIs than Google Cloud Storage. Google Cloud PubSub has different APIs than Amazon Kinesis. Since different clouds have different APIs, developers have trouble connecting cloud resources together, and it has become difficult to migrate your entire application from one cloud provider to another.</p><p>Crossplane is an open source control plane for managing resources across multiple clouds. Crossplane’s goal is to provide a single API surface for interfacing with all the parts of your application, regardless of what cloud they are on.</p><p>Crossplane is a project that was started by Upbound, a company with the goal of making multicloud software development easier. Bassam Tabbara is the CEO of Upbound, and he joins the show to talk about multi cloud deployments, Kubernetes federation, and his strategy for building a multi cloud API.</p>',

Mars could be a place for new ideas and new cultures, unfettered by the conventions of Earth.</p><p>Mike Solana is the host of <a href="https://foundersfund.com/anatomy-of-next/podcasts/">Anatomy of Next, a podcast</a> about technologies and philosophies of the future.

He co-wrote <em><a href="https://www.blitzscaling.com/">Blitzscaling</a></em> with LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman.  </p><p>Blitzscaling is a strategy for growing a company that has found product market fit. Blitzscaling prioritizes speed over efficiency, arguing that fast growth is necessary to achieve “first scaler advantage.” When a company is the first to scale successfully within a large market, that company gains access to a wealth of market opportunities that are not available to companies which are not at scale.</p><p>Examples of successful Blitzscalers include Airbnb, LinkedIn, Amazon, and Facebook. In the hypergrowth phases of these companies, there were deliberate strategic tradeoffs that caused the company to suffer in the short term in exchange for the chance at market dominance in the long term.</p><p>Blitzscaling is a broad strategic concept which manifests differently in different companies. </p><p>When Airbnb was in its early stages of growth in 2011, the company was faced with the existential threat of a European competitor called Wimdu. Wimdu offered to sell to Airbnb, but this would have required the merger of two companies with distinctly different cultures. Instead, Airbnb chose to raise more money and rapidly expand into Europe.</p><p>In contrast, Google’s rapid path to becoming a dominant information service involved acquisitions that we now see as key Google products, including Android, Google Maps, and Google Earth.</p><p>Through numerous examples in recent business history, Blitzscaling explores the fundamental tradeoff between speed and efficiency, usually biasing speed as the preferable element. But Blitzscaling does not work for every company. </p><p>In the food delivery sector, many companies who tried to blitzscale ended up going out of business because they had lowered their prices too much in order to try to earn customer loyalty. By lowering their prices too much, food delivery startups built businesses with fundamentally bad unit economics and a fickle customer base.</p><p>In other cases, aggressive blitzscaling can work for a short period of time, but can cause a company’s culture to suffer in ways that are very hard to repair. Blitzscaling can also cause problems in a core software product. Growing too quickly can cause a product to have a bloated user interface. If the backend infrastructure layer expands too quickly, sensitive data could be left exposed due to a lack of proper software security policies.</p><p>Chris Yeh joins the show to talk about the strategy of Blitzscaling and his wide-ranging career. Chris studied creative writing and product design at Stanford before joining DE Shaw, the famous quantitative hedge fund. Later, he became an investor and worked in several leadership roles in software companies. </p><p>His wide range of experiences make Chris an excellent author and conversationalist. We explored the ideas of both Blitzscaling and his previous book <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Alliance-Managing-Talent-Networked-Age/dp/1625275773">The Alliance</a></em>, which lays out a modern vision for the dynamic between employers and employees. We also talked about investing, Dungeons and Dragons, and podcasting.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>A grocery store contains fruit, vegetables, meat, bread, and other items that can expire. In order to keep these items in stock, the store must be aware of how much food has been sold and what has gone bad. When a food item is low in stock, the store needs to order more of that food from a central distribution system.</p><p>Managing food inventory is not simple. Some kinds of meat might expire faster than others. Avocados do not become ripe at the same rate as apples. In order to keep the shelves stocked, there are manual workflows for checking the inventory and ordering new inventory.</p><p>Afresh is a company that builds software for grocery stores. </p><p>Afresh works with grocery chains that have a central distribution center. These grocery stores already have some software. At the back of the store, inventory management systems maintain records of the items that the store has on the shelves. At the front of the store, checkout systems detect what has been sold and help to update inventory. When the inventory is running low, the store can order more inventory from the central distribution center, so that trucks can deliver more inventory.</p><p>Afresh improves the operational intelligence of these stores by detecting spoilage among items that are prone to expiration, such as fruit. Volodomyr Kuleshov is the CTO and co-founder of Afresh and he joins the show to discuss the technical challenges of a grocery store, and the software that Afresh is building to make groceries more intelligent.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Kubernetes has become the standard system for deploying and managing clusters of containers. But the vision of the project goes beyond managing containers. The long-term goal is to democratize the ability to build distributed systems.</p><p>Brendan Burns is a co-founder of the Kubernetes project. He recently announced an open source project called Metaparticle, a standard library for cloud-native development:</p><p>Metaparticle builds on top of Kubernetes primitives to make distributed synchronization easier… It supplies language independent modules for locking and leader election as easy-to-use abstractions in familiar programming languages.</p><p>After decades of distributed systems research and application, patterns have emerged about how we build these systems. We need a way to lock a variable, so that two nodes will not be able to write to that variable in a nondeterministic fashion. We need a way to do master election, so that if the master node dies, the other nodes can pick a new node to orchestrate the system.</p><p>We know that just about every distributed application needs locking and leader election–so how can we build these features directly into our programming tools, rather than bolting them on?</p><p>With Kubernetes providing a standard operating system for distributed applications, we can start to build standard libraries that assume we have access to underlying Kubernetes primitives. Instead of calling out to external tools like Zookeeper and etcd, a standard library like Metaparticle will abstract them away.</p><p>An example: if I am writing a system to do distributed mapreduce, I would like to avoid thinking about node failures and race conditions. Brendan’s idea is to push those problems down into a standard library–so the next developer who comes along with a new idea for a multi-node application has an easier time. </p><p>Brendan Burns currently works as a distinguished engineer at Microsoft, and he joins the show to discuss why it is still hard to build distributed systems and what can be done to make it easier. This is the second time we have had Brendan on the show. The first time he came on, he discussed the history of Kubernetes, and some of the design decisions of the system. This episode was more about the future. Full disclosure: Microsoft (where Brendan is employed) is a sponsor of Software Engineering Daily.</p><p>Transcript provided by We Edit Podcasts.

When a developer runs Draft, a Dockerfile is created to containerize the application, and a Helm Chart is created to enable the application to be easily deployed.</p><p>Brigade is a tool for creating and running Kubernetes workflows. Brigade allows for event-driven scripting on top of Kubernetes. Chatops, continuous integration systems, and complex big data pipelines can all be defined with Brigade. Brigade is exciting, because it is a higher level tool on top of Kubernetes–in some ways similar to the “serverless on Kubernetes” systems we have covered in the past.</p><p>Ralph Squillace is a principal program manager with Microsoft, where he works on containers, Linux, and cloud products.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>On this show, we spend a lot of time talking about CI/CD, data engineering, and microservices. These technologies have only been widely talked about for the last 5-10 years. That means that they are easy to adopt for startups that get founded in the last 5-10 years, but not necessarily for older enterprises.</p><p>Within a large enterprise, it can be challenging to make significant changes to how technology is used. Many of the listeners might even take it for granted that your source code is in git–but if you work at an enterprise that started building software in 1981, you might be moving source code around on FTP servers or floppy disks.</p><p>The difficulty of changing the technology within an enterprise gets compounded by culture. Culture develops around specific technologies. That is one interpretation of “Conway’s Law”–that the way an organization uses software informs an organization’s communication structure. This is no surprise–if your organization manages code using FTP servers and floppy disks, it will slow down your innovation.</p><p>Zhamak Dehghani is an engineer at ThoughtWorks, where she consults with enterprises to modernize their software and culture. She works off of a blueprint that describes specific steps that an enterprise can take towards modernizing: continuous integration; building a data pipeline; building a system of experimentation. In some ways, this conversation fits nicely with our shows about DevOps a few years ago.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Donald Trump has either alarmed or excited everyone in the engineering community.</p><p>Some of the debates are based around innovation. Opponents to Trump say that his anti-immigration policies will reduce the innovation that relies on H1-B visas. Supporters of Trump say that his anti-regulation policies will unlock innovation that is restricted by bureaucracy.</p><p>Other debates are around philosophy and free speech. Opponents to Trump say that his views on women are retrograde and that he promotes racism and white nationalism. Supporters of Trump say that he is brave enough to say what people are really thinking, and that he is truly independent from the polarized, ossified political system.</p><p>Software Engineering Daily is a show about the world through the lens of the software engineer, and today our world is being shaped by Donald Trump. We needed to do an episode on this subject because so many of my day-to-day conversations with other engineers were becoming about Trump.</p><p>Brad Taylor is a senior engineer with Optimizely who has formed Tech Stands Up, a grassroots movement giving a voice to the rapidly growing concerns about the Trump administration’s policies affecting the tech community and its users. We had a stimulating conversation about the tradeoffs of a Trump administration from an engineer’s perspective.</p><p>Don’t worry–this is not becoming a show about politics.</p><p><a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/tech-stands-up-pi-day-rally-tickets-32358472061">Tech Stands Up: Pi Day Rally Tickets</a></p><p><a href="https://www.techstandsup.org">TechStandsUp.org</a></p>',

Shopify has built upon the same Ruby on Rails application since the founding of their business 12 years ago starting with Rails 0.5 and moving all the way to Rails 5.  </p><p> MRuby is a lightweight implementation of the Ruby language. Shopify made the decision to use mruby to allow customers to create custom scripts that are run every time a customer adds items to their cart. However, since mruby was a language implementation that was not widely used, Shopify opted to post a Bug Bounty to the HackerOne bug bounty platform to find security vulnerabilities in their use of mruby. What followed was a payout of over $500,000 as report after report flooded in of security vulnerabilities inside mruby itself. There was so many reports that Shopify made the decision to sandbox the mruby execution into separate processes and decreased the bounty awards by 90%.</p><p>In this episode, Jeremy Jung interviews Daniel Bovensiepen (BOH-ven-see-pen) about mruby and the Shopify bug bounty.</p><p>Mruby:<a href="http://mruby.org/"> http://mruby.org/</a></p><p>The $500,000 release:<a href="http://mruby.sh/201703270126.html"> http://mruby.sh/201703270126.html</a></p><p>HackerOne bounty page:<a href="https://hackerone.com/shopify-scripts"> https://hackerone.com/shopify-scripts</a></p><p>American Fuzzy Lop:<a href="http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/"> http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/</a></p><p>Transcript provided by We Edit Podcasts.

In today’s episode, Eduardo Silva joins the show to describe how Fluentd is deployed to Kubernetes, and what the role of Fluentd is within a Kubernetes logging pipeline. </p><p>We also discuss the company where Eduardo works–Treasure Data. The story of Treasure Data is unusual. The team started out doing log management, but has found itself moving up the stack, into marketing analytics, sales analytics, and customer data management.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Every company that deals with payments deals with fraud. The question is not whether fraud will occur on your system, but rather how much of it you can detect and prevent. If a payments company flags too many transactions as fraudulent, then real transactions might accidentally get flagged as well. But if you don’t reject enough of the fraudulent transactions, you might not be able to make any money at all.</p><p>Because fraud detection is such a difficult optimization problem, it is a good fit for machine learning. Today’s guest Michael Manapat works on machine learning fraud detection at Stripe.</p><p>This conversation explores aspects of both data science and data engineering. Michael seems to benefit from having a depth of knowledge in both aspects of the data pipeline, which made me question whether data science and data engineering are roles that an engineering organization wants to separate.</p><p>This is the third in a series of episodes about Stripe engineering. Throughout these episodes, we’ve tried to give a picture for how Stripe’s engineering culture works. We hope to do more experimental series like this in the future.

Jenkins was one of the first continuous delivery tools and is still in heavy use today. Netflix’s open sourced Spinnaker has also been widely adopted.</p><p>As Kubernetes has grown in popularity, some engineers have developed a workflow around Kubernetes and Git known as GitOps. GitOps treats Git as the source of truth for deployments. Under GitOps, when a divergence occurs between your git repository’s configuration files and the state of your production infrastructure, your infrastructure should automatically adjust its state to align with the state defined in git.</p><p>Alexis Richardson is the CEO of Weaveworks, a company that has built tooling around GitOps. He joins the show to describe how GitOps works, and explain how it compares to other methods for continuous delivery.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Facebook engineering is designed to self-assemble. </p><p>When an engineer joins Facebook, the engineer goes through boot camp, where they are exposed to multiple projects to find a good fit in terms of technical skills and personal preferences. Since there are so many different initiatives within the company at any given moment, a new hire can usually find something to work on through this exploration.</p><p>As an engineer builds credibility within Facebook, opportunities to move to other projects or to become a manager will present themselves, allowing the engineer to move within the company as they mature and their interests change. The sense of autonomy and freedom to explore is one feature of Facebook engineering that distinguishes the company.</p><p>Facebook is a flat, decentralized organization by nature. But there have been existential moments in Facebook’s history where an executive mandate was required. During these existential situations, Facebook centralizes and becomes a more top-down environment.</p><p>Facebook’s most crucial inflection point to date was its shift to focusing on mobile computing.</p><p>Even two years after the launch of the iPhone, it was not obvious that the world of consumer computing would change completely due to mobile devices. Facebook was becoming a dominant place where consumers navigated to on desktop, and Facebook engineering was focused on optimizing that desktop experience.</p><p>As the impact of the iPhone became noticeable, Facebook found itself with a desktop web product in the middle of a platform shift away from the desktop. During this same time, Facebook was beginning to succeed with its advertising platform and was evaluating an initial public offering.</p><p>Facebook leadership was able to recognize the importance of mobile computing in time to develop high quality mobile applications, but there were numerous challenges.</p><p>The Facebook desktop web app had been difficult enough to build due to the unprecedented data requirements and amount of interactivity. Mobile introduced the additional hurdles of limited bandwidth and distinct native operating systems in Android and iPhone. </p><p>Facebook’s early efforts to build a mobile application involved a cross-platform HTML5 solution. HTML5 had insufficient performance for Facebook’s needs, and the company needed to develop native apps in order to deliver the desired experience.</p><p>Facebook’s ability to pivot to mobile is comparable to <a href="https://anthonysmoak.com/2016/03/27/andy-grove-and-intels-move-from-memory-to-microprocessors/">the classic story of Intel pivoting from a memory company to a microprocessor company.</a> To succeed at mobile application development, Facebook had to shift its focus dramatically, reallocating engineering resources and acqui-hiring small mobile companies in order to build up the domain expertise for mobile.</p><p>As a side effect of this transition to mobile, Facebook developed an understanding of how dramatically software engineering was changed by the introduction of smartphones and the high bandwidth requirements of social networking. The challenges of this new paradigm led to the development of open source tools such as GraphQL and React Native, which have allowed countless projects to build applications more easily.</p><p>Jocelyn Goldfein was an engineering director at Facebook for four years, from 2010 to 2014. She currently works as an investor at Zetta Venture Partners. In her time at Facebook, Jocelyn saw the shift to mobile firsthand. In today’s episode, she describes how Facebook management works, and gives her perspective on the distinguishing characteristics of the engineering organization as a whole.</p><p>RECENT UPDATES:</p><p><a href="http://findcollabs.com/open">The FindCollabs Open has started.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Linkedin is an organization with thousands of employees. An enterprise of that size starts to develop problems with data collaboration. Data collaboration is the process of sharing and analyzing data with multiple users, such as data scientists, business analysts, and engineers.</p><p>How do data scientists know what questions to ask? How do business analysts know the right way to query a database? How does a data engineer even find where the right database is within the company infrastructure? And how can these different users share information with each other so that redundant work is avoided?</p><p>When Adam Weinstein was at Linkedin, he saw these problems firsthand. The process of accessing and utilizing data felt slow and broken. Engineers were searching through a company wiki to find out how to leverage data, and the wiki was often out of date. When an engineer would leave the company, there was not a durable, institutional memory of how that engineer worked with data.</p><p>Adam used this experience as inspiration for Cursor, a tool for data collaboration. Cursor allows different users in the data pipeline to share data sets, queries, access patterns, and comments about data within a company. Cursor is used by Linkedin, Slack, Apple, and other companies. Adam is the CEO of Cursor, and he joins the show for an interview about the problems and opportunities of data collaboration.</p>',

We are now able to watch our favorite TV shows, movies, or content creators on a range of devices. However, buffering while watching videos can be a painful experience on mobile phones and tablets that use 4G or LTE. As streaming becomes available to a wider range of devices with varying bandwidth restrictions, different encodings of the video need to be created for different devices, and different bandwidth situations.</p><p>To get the best quality viewing possible with the bandwidth available to connections, there needs to be a balance between the resolution of the video, and the bitrate, which defines the data that the video consumes. </p><p>Mux is a company that builds video hosting and analytics. Ben Dodson is a data scientist at Mux, who built a system for optimizing the bitrate of videos through machine learning. In this episode we discuss video encoding and how Mux solved the problem of serving the highest quality video with the ideal bitrate. </p>',

Anthony started Decentral in 2014, which is a hub for his projects in the cryptocurrency space, the most impactful project being Jaxx.</p><p>Jaxx is a blockchain wallet that can hold multiple different cryptocurrencies. It works by connecting a small client-side application to remote full nodes. The user interface is simple, and Jaxx maintains the full node instances that the small client-side application connects to. We discuss the architecture of Jaxx in more detail during this episode.</p><p>We also talk about Anthony’s background–which includes a wide range of businesses: marketing, patio door manufacturing, real estate, and eventually blockchains. Anthony had a wealth of information to provide around entrepreneurship–both inside and outside of the blockchain space.</p><p>If you are looking for all 700 episodes of Software Engineering Daily, check out our apps on the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/software-engineering-daily/id1253734426?mt=8">iOS</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.koalatea.thehollidayinn.softwareengineeringdaily&amp;hl=en">Android</a> app store.

But before a machine learning model can be used to make these inferences, the model must be trained and deployed. </p><p>In the training process, a machine learning model consumes a data set and learns from it. The training process can consume significant resources. After the training process is over, you have a trained model that you need to get into production. This is known as the “deployment” step.</p><p>Deployment can be a hard problem. You are taking a program from a training environment to a production environment. A lot can change between these two environments. In production, your model is running on a different machine–which can lead to compatibility issues. If your model serves a high volume of requests, it might need to scale up. In production, you also need caching, and monitoring, and logging.</p><p>Large companies like Netflix, Uber, and Facebook have built their own internal systems to control the pipeline of getting a model from training into production. Companies who are newer to machine learning can struggle with this deployment process, and these companies usually don’t have the resources to build their own machine learning platform like Netflix.</p><p>Diego Oppenheiner is the CEO of Algorithmia, a company that has built a system for automating machine learning deployments. This is the second cool product that Algorithmia has built, the first being <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2016/06/19/algorithm-marketplace-diego-oppenheimer-algorithmia/">the algorithm marketplace</a> that we covered in an episode a few years ago. </p><p>In today’s show, Diego describes the challenges of deploying a machine learning model into production, and how that product was a natural complement to the algorithms marketplace.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>DevSecOps emphasizes moving security out of a siloed audit process and distributing security practices throughout the software supply chain.</p><p>In the past, software development usually followed a waterfall development process. Each step in building software was serialized, one after another. First, software was planned. Then it was built. Then it was tested. Finally, the software received a security audit at the end. If a security vulnerability was not discovered during that audit, it was likely that the software would be released with the vulnerability.</p><p>With continuous delivery, we can be continuously checking for security. Every new release can be tested against a battery of automated security tests. The open source libraries we use can be scanned to make sure they are up-to-date with patched versions. Static analysis can discover memory leaks and buffer overrun vulnerabilities.</p><p>Edward Thomson is the principal program manager for Azure DevOps at Microsoft. He joins the show to talk about how an organization can adopt DevSecOps and introduce security practices into continuous delivery pipelines. We also talk more philosophically about security–defining the most common security risks of a software company today, from “shadow IT infrastructure” to phishing.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Automation is changing the labor market. </p><p>To automate a task, someone needs to put in the work to describe the task correctly to a computer. For some tasks, the reward for automating a task is tremendous–for example, putting together mobile phones. In China, companies like FOXCONN are investing time and money into programming the instructions for how to assemble your phone. Robots execute those instructions. </p><p>FOXCONN spends millions of dollars deploying these robots, but it is a worthwhile expense. Once FOXCONN pays off the capital investment in those robots, they have a tireless workforce that can build phones all day long. Humans require training, rest, and psychological considerations. And with robots, the error rate is lower. Your smart phone runs your life, and you do not want the liability of human imperfection involved in constructing that phone.</p><p>As we race towards an automated future, the manual tasks that get automated first depend on their economic value. The manual labor costs of smartphone construction is a massive expense for corporations. This is also true for truck driving, food service, and package delivery. The savings that will be reaped from automating these tasks are tremendous–regardless of how we automate them.</p><p>There two ways of building automated systems: rule-based systems and machine learning.</p><p>With rule-based systems, we can describe to the computer exactly what we want it to do–like following a recipe. With machine learning, we can train the computer by giving it examples and let the computer derive its own understanding of how to automate a task. </p><p>Both approaches to automation have difficulties. A rule-based approach requires us to enumerate every single detail to the machine. This might work well in a highly controlled environment like a manufacturing facility. But rule-based systems don’t work well in the real world, where there are so many unexpected events, like snowstorms. </p><p>As we reported <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2017/07/28/self-driving-deep-learning-with-lex-fridman/">in a previous episode about how to build self-driving cars</a>, engineers still don’t quite know what the right mix of rule-based systems and machine learning techniques are for autonomous vehicles. But we will continue to pour money into solving this problem, because the investment is worth figuring out how to train the machine.</p><p>The routine tasks in our world will be automated given enough time. How soon something will be automated depends on how expensive that task is when it is performed by a human, and how hard it is to design an artificial narrow intelligence to perform the task instead of a human.</p><p>Manual software testing is another type of work that is being automated today.</p><p>If I am building a mobile app to play podcast episodes, and I make a change to the user interface, I want to have manual quality assurance (QA) testers run through tests that I describe to them, to make sure my change did not break anything. QA tests describe high level application functionality. Can the user register and log in? Can the user press the play button and listen to a podcast episode on my app?</p><p>Unit tests are not good enough, because unit tests only verify the logic and the application state from the point of view of the computer itself. Manual QA tests ensure that the quality of the user experience was not impacted.</p><p>With so many different device types, operating systems, and browsers, I need my QA test to be executed in all of the different target QA environments. This requires lots of manual testers. If I want manual testing for every deployment I push, that manual testing can get expensive.</p><p>RainforestQA is a platform for QA testing that turns manual testing into automated testing. The manual test procedures are recorded, processed by computer vision, and turned into automated tests. RainforestQA hires human workers from Amazon Mechanical Turk to execute the well-defined manual tests, and the recorded manual procedure is used to train the machines that can execute the same task in the future.</p><p>Russell Smith is the CTO and co-founder of RainforestQA, and he joins the show to explain how RainforestQA works: the engineering infrastructure, the process of recruiting workers from mechanical turk, and the machine learning system for taking manual tasks and automating them.</p><p>Transcript provided by We Edit Podcasts.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p><em>The New York Times</em> is a newspaper that evolved into a digital publication. Across its 166 year history, <em>The Times</em> has been known for longform journalistic quality, in addition to its ability to quickly churn out news stories. Some content on the <em>New York Times</em> is old but timeless “evergreen” content. </p><p>Readers of the <em>New York Times</em> website are not only looking for the most recent news–they want to know what the headlines were the day after Pearl Harbor. They want to read editorials about Martin Luther King. Over the last 30 years, <em>New York Times</em> has moved itself online, bringing old material with it. </p><p>Since the 90s, several different content management systems (CMS) have been used by journalists within <em>The</em> <em>Times</em>. These different sources of content store data in different formats. </p><p>This is a data management problem. Users want to search over the entire history of articles published by <em>The Times</em>, which means that <em>The Times</em> needs to unify those articles in a single index. These are articles from the 1920s that were digitized using OCR, articles from 1998 that were written on a legacy CMS, and articles from 2017 that use the latest CMS.</p><p>Boerge Svingen is the director of engineering at NYT, and he wrote about <a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/publishing-apache-kafka-new-york-times/">this problem and its solution on Medium</a>. This story describes the flexibility of Kafka; in contrast to the applications of Kafka as a place to buffer high volumes of data, the New York Times uses Kafka as a place to unify data and allow for other specific materialized views to be built on top of it.</p><p>We have covered Kafka in the past with interviews of some of its creators–including Jay Kreps and Neha Narkhede.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>The pubsub pattern allows a developer to create channels, which messages can be written to and read from. Pubsub messaging is useful for multicast messaging–when you want to publish messages from a producer, and have multiple consumers who are subscribed to the publisher receive those messages. Almost any application that reaches a high level of complexity will need a pubsub system of some kind. </p><p>The pubsub system itself can be complex. A pubsub system needs to scale up and down to handle different numbers of consumers and producers, and different volumes of messages. Back in 2010, the growth of mobile and cloud was leading to many new applications with high throughput, multi-user interactions. Developers were standing up their own instances of open source pubsub message queueing systems like RabbitMQ and ZeroMQ. Once the MQ systems needed to scale, the developer would need to handle the scaling. Stephen Blum started his company PubNub around this time, to create automatically scaling APIs for messaging.</p><p>Stephen joins the show to discuss the infrastructure choices around building a large scale pubsub service, and how the company has scaled over time. He also talks about the management, product development, and business side of running the company. PubNub has built several additional technologies on top of the core infrastructure that was originally for messaging.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>When I log into my bank account from my laptop, I first enter my banking password. Then the bank sends a text message to my phone with a unique code, and I enter that code into my computer to finish the login. This login process is two-factor authentication. I am proving my identity by entering my banking password (the first factor) and validating that I am in control of my phone (the second factor) by receiving that text message.</p><p>But in order to log in from my laptop, I need to be in control of my laptop. The laptop itself is a factor. With the laptop and my password, I have two factors. I might not actually need the phone as a factor.</p><p>Praneet Sharma is the CEO of <a href="http://keyless-tech.com/">Keyless</a>, a product that moves 2-factor authentication into the browser. Praneet joins the show to discuss how all kinds of authentication work: multi-factor authentication, single sign on, and Yubikey. We use this discussion of authentication methods to help explain why it actually could make sense for some people to be doing 2-factor authentication without requiring people to take out their phone.</p><p>We also explore recent security breaches like Target, Equifax and Yahoo–and the industry of security software sold to developers. I see giant banners for security software companies every time I go into the San Francisco airport, and Praneet explained to me some of the products that these kinds of companies are selling.</p><p>Praneet has joined the show in a previous episode to talk about advertising fraud.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Ten years ago, if you wanted to build software, you probably needed to know how to write code. Today, the line between “technical” and “non-technical” people is blurring.</p><p>Website designers can make a living building sites for people on WordPress or Squarespace–without knowing how to write code. Salesforce integration experts can help a sales team set up complicated software–without knowing how to write code. Shopify experts can set up an ecommerce store to your exact specifications–without knowing how to write code.</p><p>WordPress, Squarespace, Salesforce, and Shopify are all fantastic services–but they are not compatible with each other. I can’t install a WordPress plugin on Salesforce.</p><p>Now imagine this from the point of view of plugin creators. Plugin creators make easy ways to integrate different pieces of software together. Take PayPal as an example. PayPal wants to make it easy for software builders to integrate with their API. </p><p>One plugin that PayPal has is a button that says “Pay with PayPal.” If I am a developer at PayPal, and I am building a button that people should be able to easily put on their webpage so that their users can pay with PayPal, I have to create a button that is compatible with WordPress, and Squarespace, and Wix, and Weebly, and GoDaddy, and Blogger, and all the other website builders that I might want to integrate with.</p><p>In 2014, Zack Bloom started a company called Eager. Eager was a cloud app marketplace which allowed app developers to make flexible plugins that non-technical users could drag and drop into their site without technical expertise. </p><p>In order for these non-technical users to add any apps from the Eager marketplace to their webpage, they had to drop in a line of JavaScript–which is, unfortunately, a significant hurdle for a nontechnical user. </p><p>Eager proved to be a useful distribution mechanism for plugin developers who could write a plugin once and get distributed to multiple plugin marketplaces. But Eager was not as widely used as a way to directly drag and drop plugins onto sites.</p><p>The question was: how do you build a marketplace for non-technical users to add plugins to any website without forcing the non-technical user to write code? How do you make editing any website as easy as a WYSIWYG editor?</p><p>The CDN turns out to be the perfect distribution platform for these kinds of apps. Users already integrate with a CDN, so the CDN can do the work of inserting the code that allows the plugins to be added to a user’s webpage. </p><p>Because of the opportunity for the integration between a plugin marketplace and a CDN, Eager was acquired by Cloudflare, and Eager became Cloudflare apps. Zack Bloom joins the show today to discuss the motivations for his company, the engineering behind building a cloud app marketplace, and the acquisition process of his company Eager.</p><p>Transcript provided by We Edit Podcasts.

Git is extremely reliable, fast, and secure, owing to the fact that it is one of the oldest pieces of open source software. But even battle-tested software can have vulnerabilities. In this episode, we explore a subtle git vulnerability that could have potentially led to git users executing malicious scripts when they intended to simply pull a repository.</p><p>Today’s guest Edward Thomson is a program manager at Microsoft, and a maintainer of libgit2, a C implementation of git. He also writes about git and hosts the podcast <a href="http://allthingsgit.com">All Things Git</a>. He is passionate about git development, which gave me a deeper perspective on something that I just consider a tool. But the only reason that tool is so good–the only reason it fades into the background–is because there are people that are passionate enough to work on it on a regular basis.</p><p>We also spent some time talking about the vulnerabilities that can spread through shared code environments–particularly in the realm of git, npm, and PHP.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>A Kubernetes instance occupies a wide footprint of multiple servers, creating an appealing target to an attacker, due to its access to a large pool of compute resources. A common attack against an exposed Kubernetes cluster is to take it over for the purposes of mining cryptocurrency. Thus it is important to keep a cluster secure.</p><p>The importance of security is magnified for a cloud provider. A cloud provider runs a managed Kubernetes service, which might be running thousands of Kubernetes clusters. If the cloud provider’s chosen distribution of Kubernetes contains a vulnerability, or if the Kubernetes instances are misconfigured, all of these clusters could be exposed to the same vulnerability.</p><p>Maya Kaczorowski works on the security of Google’s managed Kubernetes service GKE. In today’s show we discuss the attack surface of a managed Kubernetes service. Maya was previously on the show to talk about container security.

AWS can monetize almost any open source project more profitably than the creators.

It is a signal that something has changed within your application. When you save a file to an Amazon S3 bucket, that creates an event. When a user signs up for your app, that can create an event.</p><p>Functions-as-a-service are allowing people to build applications completely out of managed cloud infrastructure. Apps can be fully “serverless”, with managed databases, queueing systems, and APIs tied together by event-triggered functions.</p><p>Today, there is not a consistent format for events across different applications and cloud providers. This makes it more difficult to stitch together events across these different environments.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>When a user interacts with an application to order a ride with a ridesharing app, the data for that user interaction is written to a “transactional” database. A transactional database is a database where specific rows need to be written to and read from quickly and consistently. </p><p>Speed and consistency are important for applications like a user ordering a car, and riding around in that car, because the user’s client is frequently communicating with the database to update their session. Other applications of a transactional database would include a database that backs a messaging system, a banking application, or document editing software.</p><p>The data from a transactional database is often reused in “analytic” databases. An analytic database can be used for performing large scale analysis, aggregations, averages, and other data science queries. </p><p>The requirements for an analytic database are different from a transactional database because the data is not being used for an active user session. To fill the data in an analytic database, the transactional data gets copied from the transactional database in a process called ETL. </p><p>The separation of the transaction data store from the analytic data store causes problems for data engineering. To address these problems, some newer databases combine transactional and analytic functionality in the same database. These databases are often called “NewSQL”.</p><p>TiDB is an open source database built on RocksDB and Kubernetes. TiDB is widely used in China by high volume applications such as bike sharing and massively multiplayer online games. Kevin Xu works at PingCAP, a company built around TiDB. He joins the show to talk about modern databases, distributed systems, and the architecture for TiDB.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Flutter is a project from Google that is rebuilding user interface engineering from the ground up. </p><p>Today, most engineering teams have dedicated engineering resources for web, iOS, and Android. These different platforms have their own design constraints, their own toolset, and their own programming languages. But each platform is merely building a user interface. Why should development across these three user surfaces be so different?</p><p>This was the question that Eric Seidel was asking himself three years ago, when he co-founded the Flutter project. The Flutter project had a few rough starts, as the team tried to figure out exactly what layer of abstraction they were trying to provide. </p><p>Around that time, ReactJS and React Native were growing in popularity. Seeing the React projects provided some data points, and some inspiration. But Flutter takes a lower level approach to cross platform app development, by presenting a rendering layer and a runtime API that are interfacing with the hardware in the same way that OpenGL does. </p><p>In today’s episode, Eric joins the show to explain how the Flutter project came to life, and his lessons from starting an ambitious project that took several years to pick up steam. I enjoyed this episode because Flutter could have massive improvements for how quickly we can build apps–and also because Eric is a serious engineer and there are so many insights in this episode about computer science, software engineering, and project management.</p><p>Transcript provided by We Edit Podcasts.

Depending on what angle you observe the company from, you can write a story depicting that company as good, evil, growing, or about to crash. The truth only becomes apparent to outsiders with time.</p><p>Amazon’s culture and business strategy were detailed in The Everything Store, a 2013 book by Brad Stone. I read <em>The Everything Store</em> before working at Amazon, then I read it a second time after working at Amazon. The book is an accurate and balanced depiction of Amazon’s ethos.</p><p>Brad’s new book The Upstarts documents the rise of Uber and Airbnb, two companies with a similar controversial valence to Amazon.</p><p>It was a pleasure to speak to Brad because I admire his engrossing storytelling as an author and his strategic analysis as a business journalist.

Online schools such as Free Code Camp allow someone to learn how to program without any experience, and with no financial payment. Boot camps with income-sharing agreements such as App Academy create an in-person education environment that mimics a university, but with better cost structure and incentive alignment.</p><p>Lambda School is an education system that takes elements of other software education models and combines them with newer SaaS technologies such as Slack and Zoom videoconferencing. Lambda School is an online software engineering curriculum with an income sharing agreement.</p><p>“Income sharing agreement” means that the student does not pay for their education until they get a job. With this model, the student can pay back Lambda School after their software engineering education gets them a high-paying software engineering job.</p><p>Andrew Madsen works at Lambda School, and he joins the show to describe the path that a student takes through Lambda School, the school’s curriculum for software education, and how Lambda School differs from the other options for coding education.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Modern frontend development is about components. Whether we are building an application in React, Vue, or Angular, components are the abstractions that we build our user interfaces out of. Today, this seems obvious, but if you think back five years ago, frontend development was much more chaotic–partly because we had not settled around this terminology of the component.</p><p>React has become the most popular frontend framework, and part of its growth is due to the ease and reusability of components across the community. It’s easy to find building blocks that you can use to piece together your frontend application. Do you need a video player component? Do you need a news feed component? A profile component? All of these things are easy to find.</p><p>As you build a React application, you take some open source components off the shelf, and you build others yourself. To keep things looking nice and consistent, you need to style your components. If you are not careful with how you manage your stylesheets, you can end up with inconsistent stylings and namespace conflicts.</p><p>Max Stoiber is the creator of styled-components, a project to help enforce best practices around styling components. He has also a founder of Spectrum, a system that allows people to build online communities. Spectrum has similar design and engineering challenges to Slack or Facebook, so it made for a great discussion of modern software architecture.</p><p>In today’s episode, Max and I had a wide-ranging conversation about frontend frameworks, components, and the process of building a product. Max also describes the advantages of using GraphQL and the Apollo toolchain.</p><p>Transcript provided by We Edit Podcasts.

Hashicorp’s thesis was that operating cloud infrastructure was too hard: there was a need for new tools to serve application developers.</p><p>Hashicorp founders Mitchell Hashimoto and Armon Dadgar began releasing open source tools to fulfill their vision of better automation. Terraform, Vagrant, Consul, and other tools created by Hashicorp gained popularity, and Hashicorp began iterating on their business model. Today, Hashicorp makes money by offering enterprise features and support to enterprises such as Pinterest, Adobe, and Cruise Automation.</p><p>Over the last seven years, enterprise software infrastructure has changed rapidly. First, enterprises moved from script-based infrastructure automation to container orchestration frameworks. Then, the container orchestration world consolidated around Kubernetes.</p><p>Today, large enterprises are rapidly adopting Kubernetes with a mix of public cloud and on-prem vendors. At the same time, these enterprises are also becoming more willing to consume proprietary tools from the public cloud providers.</p><p>Hashicorp has benefitted from all of this change. Their different tools fit into a variety of workflows, and are not closely coupled with any particular cloud provider or platform solution.</p><p>Armon and Mitchell join today’s show to discuss the business model and the product philosophy of Hashicorp. We also touch on service mesh, zero trust networking, and their lessons from the container orchestration wars.</p>',

A few weeks ago, we published Courtland Allen’s talk about how to build a small software business. In today’s episode, we are publishing Haseeb Qureshi’s talk, called “Everything That Rises Must Converge: Why Engineers Disagree About Everything (And Why Fraudsters Do Too).”</p><p>This talk explores philosophy, poker, software engineering, fraud, and a basket of other topics. These topics might sound like a random collection, but Haseeb currently works as an engineer on Airbnb’s Risk team and he is the author of <em>How To Be a Poker Player</em>, which is a book on the philosophy of poker.</p><p>The audio is taken from the Meetup and we cleaned it up as best we could.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>The Ethereum community started as a small group of dedicated engineers. It has ballooned to thousands of engineers, entrepreneurs and investors, all of whom have a stake in the direction of Ethereum. Ethereum is an open source project, and the direction of a popular open source project can get complex.</p><p>Ethereum is figuring out how to govern itself. It’s not clear what the perfect model is, but there are a few historical examples to think about: namely Linux and Bitcoin.</p><p>Linux is similar to Ethereum in that there is a clear leader—Linux has Linus Torvalds and Ethereum has Vitalik Buterin. Linux is massively successful, and the Linux development team does have a top-down, hierarchical approach. But does a hierarchy with clear leadership make sense for a project like Ethereum, which has decentralization at its core?</p><p>Bitcoin is headless—Satoshi disappeared in 2010, and there is not an official leader. Bitcoin has succeeded without a well-defined hierarchy–depending on what your definition of success is. Bitcoin development does not move as fast as Ethereum (this is by design)—but there is more widespread trust that the integrity of the system cannot be compromised by its creator.</p><p>Hudson Jameson is an Ethereum developer and entrepreneur who has been part of the community since the early days. He works on Ethereum governance, which defines how changes to the Ethereum project are proposed, accepted, and implemented. Hudson joins the show today to talk about Ethereum governance, smart contracts, and the DAO hack. We did not discuss on-chain vs. off-chain governance, but I am hoping to cover that in a future episode.</p><p>Transcript provided by We Edit Podcasts.

Every service needs tools around monitoring, alerting, debugging, and distributed tracing.</p><p>One benefit of working at a large company like Google is that an engineer building a new product gets this kind of tooling by default. If I am hacking on a project at home, I have to set up all kinds of tools to help me diagnose and resolve problems. Setting up this tooling takes time, and requires expertise.</p><p>Stackdriver is a set of tools and instrumentation that allows developers to monitor, debug, and inspect infrastructure.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>WebAssembly is a low-level compilation target for any programming language that can be interpreted into WebAssembly. Alternatively, WebAssembly is a way to run languages other than JavaScript in the browser. Or, yet another way of describing WebAssembly is a virtual machine for executing code in a low level, well-defined sandbox.</p><p>WebAssembly is reshaping what is possible to do in the web browser. A developer can write a program in Rust or C++, compile it down into a WebAssembly module, and call out to that module via JavaScript. This is very useful for running memory-sensitive workloads in the browser—such as 3-D games.</p><p>But WebAssembly is also useful for running modules outside of the browser. Why is that important? If you can already run C++ or Rust code outside of the browser by executing the program from the command line, why would you want to put the code into a WebAssembly module before executing it? One answer is security. WebAssembly modules have well-defined semantics for what memory they can access. WebAssembly could provide more reliable sandboxing for untrusted code.</p><p>Steve Klabnik is a software engineer at Mozilla, and he joins the show today to play the role of a WebAssembly futurist. We revisit the basics of WebAssembly and the current state of the technology. Steve talks Steve also describes the lessons of past web technologies such as Flash—and what they did right and wrong. We also explore the current and future applications of WebAssembly, which we will talk about in more detail in tomorrow’s episode.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>A database stores data to an underlying section of storage. If you are an application developer, you might think of your persistent storage system as being the database itself–but at a lower level, that database is writing to block storage, file storage, or object storage.</p><p>A container orchestration system manages application containers. If you want to run WordPress (a blogging platform) on Kubernetes, that means you also need to run a database to store your blog posts in a persistent way. To run a database, you need to have an underlying storage medium–which could be a disk that is at your on-prem data center, or block storage on a disk at a cloud provider.</p><p>Kubernetes is not the only container orchestrator. There’s also Cloud Foundry, Mesos, Docker Swarm, and several others. Each of these container orchestrators needs to be able to run a variety of persistent workloads (such as a MySQL database or a Kafka cluster). Each of these persistent workloads needs to be able to use different types of backing storage.</p><p>With the range of container orchestrators and the range of backing storage types, a problem arises. Every storage type would have to write custom code to connect to each container orchestrator. </p><p>The solution to this is the CSI: the container storage interface. The CSI is an interface layer between the container orchestrator and the backing storage system. In today’s episode, Jie Yu from Mesosphere describes the motivation for the CSI, and gives an overview for its design principles. There are great lessons here for anyone working with containers or distributed systems in general.</p><p>Transcript provided by We Edit Podcasts.

A modern shipping yard has hundreds of computers working together to orchestrate and analyze the freight that is coming in from overseas. A modern factory has temperature gauges and smart security cameras to ensure workplace safety.</p><p>All of these devices could be considered “edge” devices. </p><p>Over the last decade, these edge devices have mostly been used to gather data and save it to an on-premise server, or to the cloud. Today, as the required volumes of data and compute scale, we look for ways to better utilize our resources. We can start to deploy more application logic to these edge devices, and build a more sophisticated relationship between our powerful cloud servers and the less powerful edge devices.</p><p>The soil sensors at the farm are recording long time series of chemical levels. The pressure sensors in a centrifuge are recording months and years of data. The cameras are recording terabytes of video. These huge data sets are correlated with labeled events–such as crop yields. </p><p>With these large volumes of data, we can construct models for responding to future events. Deep learning can be used to improve systems over time. The models can be trained in the cloud, and deployed to devices at the edge.</p><p>Aran Khanna is an AI engineer with Amazon Web Services, and he joins the show to discuss workloads at the cloud and at the edge–how work can be distributed between the two places, and the tools that can be used to build edge deep learning systems more easily.</p><p>To find all of our shows about machine learning and edge computing, as well as links to learn more about the topics described in the show, download the Software Engineering Daily app for <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/software-engineering-daily/id1253734426?mt=8">iOS</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.koalatea.thehollidayinn.softwareengineeringdaily&amp;hl=en">Android</a>.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>“Internet of Things” is a term used to describe the increasing connectivity and intelligence of physical objects within our lives. </p><p>IoT has manifested within enterprises under the term “Industrial IoT,” as wireless connectivity and machine learning have started to improve devices such as centrifuges, conveyor belts, and factory robotics. In the consumer space, IoT has moved slower than many people expected, and it remains to be seen when we will have widespread computation within consumer devices such as microwaves, washing machines, and lightswitches.</p><p>IoT computers have different constraints than general purpose computers. Security, reliability, battery life, power consumption, and cost structures are very different in IoT devices than in your laptop or smartphone. One technology that could solve some of the problems within IoT is WebAssembly, a newer binary instruction format for executable programs.</p><p>Jonathan Beri is a software engineer and the organizer of the San Francisco WebAssembly Meetup. He has significant experience in the IoT industry, and joins the show to discuss the state of WebAssembly, the surrounding technologies, and their impact on IoT.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>You have heard the phrase: every company is becoming a software company. An insurance company is now supposed to turn into a software company that sells insurance. A clothing retailer needs to reinvent itself to be able to build software to manage the production and distribution of its clothing.</p><p>Software applications provide so much leverage to an organization, it seems smart to develop in-house software teams to build those applications. But does it really make sense? Is there a better alternative?</p><p>In the 90s outsourcing was a common solution to this problem. If you didn’t have software expertise at your company, you would hire a large consulting firm. These firms would often hire inexperienced offshore developers, and the resulting code quality was not so great.</p><p>Because of the bad experiences of the first Internet boom, companies became more cautious about outsourcing their engineering work–which led to today, where the standard is to hire your own software team.</p><p>The world has changed in ways that have made outsourcing a more viable solution. </p><p>Programming best practices are more widely understood. There is an international community of software engineers that share information on places like Stack Overflow, Quora, and Twitter.  Off-the-shelf collaboration tools make it much easier to communicate the requirements of a project to a team of developers.</p><p>Gigster is a company that is working to optimize the engineering of software projects. Large enterprises come to Gigster to build new projects from scratch–whether that project is a marketplace, a mobile application, or a machine learning model. Roger Dickey is the CEO of Gigster, and he joins the show to describe how Gigster works, and why it often makes sense for companies to focus on their core competency and outsource software engineering.</p><p>Some of our most popular episodes of Software Engineering Daily describe how leading software companies are being built–we have covered Giphy, Netflix, Digital Ocean, Stripe, and many others.  Download <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/software-engineering-daily-podcast-app/id1253734426?mt=8">the Software Engineering Daily app for iOS</a> or Android to hear all of our old episodes.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Apache Spark is a system for processing large data sets in parallel. The core abstraction of Spark is the resilient distributed dataset (RDD), a working set of data that sits in memory for fast, iterative processing.</p><p>Matei Zaharia created Spark with two goals: to provide a composable, high-level set of APIs for performing distributed processing; and to provide a unified engine for running complete apps.</p><p>High-level APIs like SparkSQL and MLlib enable developers to build ambitious applications quickly. A developer using SparkSQL can work interactively with a huge dataset, which is a significant improvement on batch Hive jobs running on Hadoop. A developer training a machine learning model can put the model through multiple steps in the training process without checkpointing the data to disk.</p><p>The second goal of Spark–a “unified engine for running complete apps”–was the focus of my conversation with today’s guest Matei Zaharia.</p><p>Matei is the CTO of Databricks, a company that was started to implement his vision for Spark and to build highly usable products on top of the technology. Databricks Delta is a project that combines a data warehouse, data lake, and streaming system–all sitting on top of Amazon S3 and using Spark for processing.</p><p>In our recent episodes about streaming, we explored some common streaming architectures. A large volume of data comes into the system and is stored in Apache Kafka. Backend microservices and distributed streaming frameworks read that data and store it in databases and data lakes. A data warehouse allows for fast access to the large volumes of data–so that machine learning systems and business analysts can work with data sets interactively.</p><p>The goal of Databricks Delta is to condense the streaming system, the data lake, and the data warehouse into a single system that is easy to use. If you listened to the previous episodes, you will have an idea for the level of complexity that is involved in managing these different systems. </p><p>For some companies, it makes complete sense to manage a Kafka cluster, a Spark cluster, a set of S3 buckets, and a data warehouse like Amazon Redshift. But we probably don’t want all of that management to the lowest barrier to entry. Delta will hopefully reduce that barrier to entry and make it easier for enterprises to set up large systems for processing data.</p><p>A few notes before we get started. We just launched the Software Daily job board. To check it out, go to softwaredaily.com/jobs. You can post jobs, you can apply for jobs, and it’s all free. If you are looking to hire, or looking for a job, I recommend checking it out. And if you are looking for an internship, you can use the job board to apply for an internship at Software Engineering Daily. </p><p>Also, Meetups for Software Engineering Daily are being planned! Go to softwareengineeringdaily.com/meetup if you want to register for an upcoming Meetup. In March, I’ll be visiting Datadog in New York and Hubspot in Boston, and in April I’ll be at Telesign in LA.</p><p>Transcript provided by We Edit Podcasts.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Containers are made to fail gracefully. When your container shuts down due to a hardware or software failure, your distributed application should be able to tolerate that failure. One simple way to be able to tolerate such a failure is to make all of your application logic “stateless.”</p><p>If your application does not maintain state, then shutting it down in the middle of a computation is not a problem–you can just restart the application, restart your computation, and get the same result.</p><p>But applications need to maintain state. We need to use databases and in-memory systems to manage long-lived user sessions and other interactions. A database is not just an on-disk abstraction–a database requires an application server to be accepting network traffic. We can run those database applications within containers.</p><p>There is a fundamental tension between stateful applications and the idea that containers are meant to tolerate failure gracefully.</p><p>Saad Ali is an engineer at Google, and he returns to the show to discuss Kubernetes storage and state management. <a href="https://youtu.be/169w6QlWhmo?t=19">He gave a keynote at KubeCon EU</a>, which I spoke to him about.</p><p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/software-engineering-daily/id1253734426?mt=8">New Software Daily app for iOS</a>.

Elasticsearch is the code that powers some search-as-a-service products offered by major cloud providers. After eight years of open source development, Elasticsearch is excellent at core search functionalities, such as indexing data, sharding, and serving queries. </p><p>With improved access to machine learning tools, search applications can advance in new and interesting ways. For example, an incoming search query can be sent to an API for natural language processing before being served by the search engine. A natural language processing API can derive additional meaning from the query, adding metadata to a search query. Machine learning can also be applied to better understand how people are searching across your search index, and to optimize the search index to incorporate those user preferences.</p><p>Liam Cavanagh is the principal program manager on Azure Search.

A component is a high level visual abstraction that is used to compose a user interface.</p><p>Frontend development has moved towards component-driven-development. At a typical technology company, a designer will put together a design file of different user interface elements, and the frontend engineer will take those UI elements and program code that can render those designs as components. As organizations have started to reuse their components and share them across the organization, the efficiency of design and frontend engineering is improving.</p><p>User interface is gaining more of an emphasis with organizations and new tools are allowing frontend engineers and designers to work together more productively. One of these tools is Storybook, a system for sharing components and the code that renders those components.</p><p>Zoltan Olah joins the show to talk about Storybook, and his company Chroma. Chroma is building tools to allow design-driven teams to work more effectively. We talked about how the relationship of designers and frontend engineers has some resemblance to the relationship between “dev” and “ops” before the DevOps movement. There are some frictions in the process of moving between design and engineering implementation, and in talking to Zoltan, I got an understanding for how much the UI layer could improve through better tooling.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>A cloud provider gives a developer low-cost compute infrastructure on-demand. </p><p>Cloud providers can be divided up into two categories: Layer 1 cloud providers and Layer 2 cloud providers. A Layer 1 cloud provider such as Amazon Web Services owns server hardware and sells compute infrastructure as a commodity. A Layer 2 cloud provider purchases compute infrastructure from a Layer 1 provider and builds a high quality developer experience on top of that compute infrastructure.</p><p>Heroku was the first Layer 2 cloud provider. Heroku’s first business was to provide a high quality developer experience and low cost containerization infrastructure on top of Amazon’s EC2 virtual machine infrastructure. Heroku has added features for continuous integration, relational databases, caches, and queueing.</p><p>Building a Layer 2 cloud provider is a very different challenge than building a Layer 1 cloud provider. A Layer 1 provider must focus on low level problems such as hardware infrastructure and virtualization. This does not leave much time for focusing on developer experience. A Layer 1 cloud provider must be able to serve every type of potential software customer. A Layer 2 provider can provide a streamlined experience.</p><p>Mark Turner is an engineer at Heroku. He joins the show to discuss the architecture and engineering of a Layer 2 cloud provider.

If I am coming from Brazil, I have a rental history of someone from Brazil. That information does not get naturally ported over to the United States. There needs to be a system for translating a foreign credit history to a US credit history.</p><p>Nova Credit is a company that makes a credit passport–a system for allowing users in one geographic location to use the credit history that they have built up to have credit in another location, namely the United States.

Courtland Allen founded Indie Hackers with the goal of sharing the stories of these businesses, and the company has become a thriving community of entrepreneurs, engineers, and creators.</p><p>Business is a creative medium. The definition of a successful business is as subjective as the rules for what makes a successful work of art. A business owner can be miserable running a company that generates millions of dollars a year, and a new entrepreneur can feel ecstatic from making their first $5 sale.</p><p>Indie Hackers is a platform that is impossible to define in relation to things you have seen before. It is a media company with <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-indie-hackers-podcast/id1206165808">a podcast that most SE Daily listeners will probably enjoy</a>. It is a social platform for learning how modern software companies are built. And it is a place where makers post their own progress on their creative projects <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/JeffMeyerson">(I have posted mine here</a>).</p><p>Courtland was on the show three years ago to discuss the Indie Hackers movement in its nascent stages. Courtland returns to the show to discuss the thriving platform as it exists today, and a wide ranging conversation about software, game theory, and podcasting.</p>',

Other stakeholders click on that link, then send messages to each other in Slack, or make comments on the pull request in GitHub.</p><p>This workflow is far from ideal. Collaborating around pull requests can be made easier with a dedicated set of tools for sharing and discussing those pull requests. This is the goal of FeaturePeek, a system for spinning up dedicated pull request environments, creating screenshots and comments, and reimagining the lifecycle of the release workflow.</p><p>Eric Silverman is a co-founder of FeaturePeek and he joins the show to discuss release management, the interactions between different stakeholders, and the development of his company. Much like the previous show about Postman, in which we explored how API management has become a ripe space for collaboration, the same is true of pull requests.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>In 2011, Facebook had begun to focus its efforts on mobile development. Mobile phones did not have access to reliable, high bandwidth connections, and the Facebook engineering team needed to find a solution to improve the request latency between mobile clients and the backend Facebook infrastructure.</p><p>One source of latency was recursive data fetching. If a mobile application client made a request to the backend for newsfeed, the backend API would return the newsfeed, but some components of that feed would require additional requests to the backend. In practice, this might result in a newsfeed loading partially on a phone, but having a delayed loading time for the comments of a newsfeed item.</p><p>GraphQL is a solution that came out of this problem of recursive data fetching. A GraphQL server provides middleware to aggregate all of the necessary information to serve a complete request. GraphQL connects to backend data sources and federates the frontend request across these different data sources.</p><p>GraphQL was open sourced in 2015, and has found many use cases in addition to simplifying backend data fetching for mobile clients. Today, GraphQL is used by PayPal, Shopify, Twitter, and hundreds of other companies.</p><p>Lee Byron is the co-creator of GraphQL and he joins the show to tell the story of GraphQL, and how it fit into Facebook’s shift to mobile.</p>',

Ryan’s goal is to connect those new programmers to companies where they can learn to apply those software skills to working at a technology company. Treehouse’s apprenticeship program is used by Airbnb, Adobe, Mailchimp, and others.</p><p>By combining an online education platform with an apprenticeship program, Treehouse has created a business model that could allow it to grow significantly bigger even in an atmosphere where learning to program has been commodified to a large extent. The economic model of Treehouse contrasts with in-person bootcamps such as Hack Reactor and online income sharing platforms such as Lambda School.</p><p>It was a great conversation about modern technology, the future of education, and the strategy of building a successful business.</p>',

You can’t use a no-code tool to build a high performance distributed database, or a real-time multiplayer video game. But they are certainly useful for building internal tools and basic CRUD applications.</p><p>We know that no-code tools can create value. But how do they fit into the overall workflow of a software company? How should teams be arranged now that knowledge workers can build certain kinds of software without writing code? And how should no-code systems interface with the monoliths, microservices, and APIs that we have building for years?</p><p>Shawn Wang is an engineer with <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/netlify">Netlify</a>, a cloud provider that is focused on delivering high-quality development and deployment experience. Netlify is not a no-code platform, but Shawn has explored and written about the potential of no-code systems.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Programming languages are dynamically typed or statically typed. In a dynamically typed language, the programmer does not need to declare if a variable is an integer, string, or other type. In a statically typed language, the developer must declare the type of the variable upfront, so that the compiler can take advantage of that information.</p><p>Dynamically typed languages give a programmer flexibility and fast iteration speed. But they also introduce the possibility of errors that can be avoided by performing type checking. This is one of the reasons why TypeScript has risen in popularity, giving developers the option to add types to their JavaScript variables.</p><p>Sorbet is a typechecker for Ruby. Sorbet allows for gradual typing of Ruby programs, which helps engineers avoid errors that might otherwise be caused by the dynamic type system. Dmitry Petrashko is an engineer at Stripe who helped build Sorbet. He has significant experience in compilers, having worked on Scala before his time at Stripe. Dmitry joins the show to discuss his work on Sorbet, and the motivation for adding type checking to Ruby.</p><p>We’re looking for new show ideas, so if you have any interesting topics, please feel free to <a href="https://twitter.com/software_daily">reach out via twitter</a> or email us at  <a href="mailto:jeff@softwareengineeringdaily.com">jeff@softwareengineeringdaily.com</a></p><p>We realize right now humanity is going through a hard time with the Caronovirus pandemic, but we all have skills useful to fight this battle.

In this essay, I just want to answer the simple question:</p><p><strong>Why did the ICO bubble happen?</strong></p><p>It’s easy to believe that the ICO bubble, having taken place on uncensorable public blockchains, was a fundamentally new phenomenon.</p><p>The technologies that enable bubbles are always new, but the underlying social dynamics are not. The open and permissionless nature of blockchains allows anyone to co-opt them. Thus, blockchains enabled multiple social forces, all interacting in the same network, all reified under the name “the ICO bubble.”</p><p>In this blog post, I’ll examine three major moments in history that illuminate three separate social dynamics that were at play in the ICO bubble.</p><p>The first is the peer-to-peer file sharing revolution in the late 2000s, which explains the ideology of decentralization, the proclamations of revolution, and companies trying to circumvent securities laws.</p><p>The second is the penny stock boom of the 90s, which explains the casino of shitcoin gambling, market manipulation, and fraudsters that comprised the long tail of ICOs.</p><p>And the third is the dotcom bubble, which explains the mass of speculators, the new paradigm of decentralized companies, the VC coins, and the redistribution of wealth.</p><p>By exploring these episodes, I hope to show you how the ICO bubble recapitulated well-known patterns of human behavior.</p><p>History does not repeat, but there are a few refrains it loves to come back to.</p><p>Bitcoin shares deep roots with the P2P networks. File sharing protocols became the world’s first global decentralized networks. Bitcoin’s gossip-based networking model was inspired by Gnutella, the protocol behind LimeWire. Many P2P barons were foundational to the crypto movement: Jed McCaleb of eDonkey2000, Zooko Wilcox of Mojo Nation, and Bram Cohen of BitTorrent to name a few. They also share a philosophical lineage — Lawrence Lessig, the intellectual godfather of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Culture_%28book%29#Piracy">piracy culture</a>, is the originator of the phrase “<a href="http://codev2.cc/download+remix/Lessig-Codev2.pdf">code is law</a>.”</p><p>The P2P file sharing revolution began in 1999, with a little application called Napster. On its face, Napster was straightforward: log in, search for a song you want, double click, and it’s yours.</p><p>It sounds simple, but it’s hard to describe how large of a paradigm shift Napster was.</p><p>Remember what it was like to purchase music in 1999: standing in a CD aisle, surrounded by rows of disc jackets, debating in your head which album to spend your $20 on. Jay-Z? Smashmouth? Or maybe J-Lo? Every purchase was a careful tradeoff. Music was scarce and precious.</p><p>Napster changed all that. It was like a bank vault of music was propped open, free for anyone to plunder. Entirely via word of mouth, Napster spread across America like a riot, clogging up bandwidth on college campuses and dialup lines.</p><p>Soon, legal challenges from Metallica and Dr. Dre would <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect">thrust Napster into news headlines</a>. Napster seized the national conscience. At its peak in 2001, the service had more than <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/history-of-napster-2438592">80M registered users</a>. The RIAA took notice.</p><p>After a lengthy court battle with the RIAA, a judge ruled Napster liable for all of its users’ copyright infringement, despite the fact that Napster’s servers didn’t host any copyrighted content. This legal doctrine, known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%26M_Records,_Inc._v._Napster,_Inc.#Vicarious_infringement"><em>vicarious infringement</em></a>, was the death knell of Napster and of any file sharing-based business model. Napster was driven to bankruptcy and forced to clamp down on all illegal file sharing. But Napster’s surrender was only the beginning of this war.</p><p>To the digital revolutionaries, the lesson of Napster was obvious. Despite all downloads being peer-to-peer, Napster operated a central server, primarily used for search indexing and peer discovery. This was its downfall. If the file sharing revolution were to continue, it would have to decentralize and become resilient to legal injunctions.</p><p>A traditional war had to evolve into guerrilla warfare.</p><p>Decentralized alternatives to Napster gradually arose, intentionally designed around this legal constraint. Successors like Gnutella (LimeWire) and eDonkey2000 (eMule) would have decentralized architectures that would be much more difficult to take down.</p><p>As the children of Napster proliferated, a philosophy began to solidify around internet piracy. Slogans materialized: “information wants to be free,” “open culture,” “sharing is caring.” A new political party called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_Parties_International">The Pirate Party</a> was formed, championing online freedom and copyright reform, winning multiple political appointments across Europe. Radical innovations in intellectual property were explored such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons">Creative Commons</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft">copyleft</a> licensing. The revolution had gained an energy and identity of its own.</p><p>BitTorrent, founded by Bram Cohen in 2001, would arguably be the last stage in the evolution of P2P file sharing. The BitTorrent protocol overtook KaZaA, Limewire, DC++, SoulSeek, and all the other P2P networks. By 2012 it’s estimated to have peaked at a staggering 400M-500M monthly active users, almost half of the entire <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2014/feb/04/facebook-in-numbers-statistics">Facebook userbase</a> at that time. During its peak, BitTorrent was by far the <a href="https://www.webcitation.org/6OVSh9hZ0?url=http://www.ipoque.com/sites/default/files/mediafiles/documents/internet-study-2008-2009.pdf">single largest source of Internet traffic in the world</a>.</p><p>It’s worth asking: why did BitTorrent dominate file sharing while other networks fell into irrelevance?</p><p>Simon Morris, a former executive at the BitTorrent company, wrote an excellent <a href="https://medium.com/@simonhmorris/why-bittorrent-mattered-bittorrent-lessons-for-crypto-1-of-4-fa3c6fcef488">four-part tour de force</a> analyzing the parallels between BitTorrent and crypto (if you can’t be bothered to read the whole thing, I encourage you to read its final chapter). I’ll be building upon many of his insights here.</p><p>BitTorrent was intentionally structured differently from other P2P file sharing projects. The project’s original home page begins its <a href="http://www.bittorrent.org/introduction.html">explanation of BitTorrent</a>like this:</p><p>It is a surprisingly dry, intellectual manifesto.</p><p>Compare this to KaZaA’s credo:</p><p>Bram Cohen explicitly disavowed all illegal file sharing usage of BitTorrent. He never once acknowledged this as a legitimate use of the service. The core team and their messaging was unimpeachable. And this is precisely what allowed BitTorrent to flourish on the back of all of its legitimate uses: Linux distros, World of Warcraft updates, dataset sharing, and so on.</p><p>BitTorrent was never supposed to be a revolution in internet piracy; it was supposed to be a revolution in low-cost file distribution. This unobjectionable mission statement made BitTorrent safely beyond the reach of the RIAA or any other aggrieved copyright holder.</p><p>There’s a striking parallel with crypto: Vitalik and the Ethereum core team never endorsed the flood of ICOs — they <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/news/ethereum-founder-cautions-ico-bubble-vitalek-buterin/">often denounced them</a>. This is precisely what allowed Ethereum to flourish, despite being subverted by ICOs for speculative and extralegal purposes. If Ethereum did not brand itself as a revolution in decentralized computing, as “the world computer,” it would have been labeled by regulators as an illegal ICO platform.</p><p>If you fast forward to today, the story of P2P file sharing is the story of BitTorrent. All other protocols have faded into obscurity. But BitTorrent is no longer used for downloading music in the western world.</p><p>Why not?</p><p>I’ll give you three reasons: Spotify, Apple Music, Pandora. Newcomers in the music industry have adapted, and these services transformed the experience of discovering and listening to music.</p><p>P2P file sharing once competed against the experience of driving to Walmart and buying a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_BMG_copy_protection_rootkit_scandal">$20 DRM-protected CD</a> to listen to a single hit song. Between the two options, the decision was comically easy: just pirate it.</p><p>Daniel Ek, the former CEO of uTorrent, understood this firsthand. After witnessing the new decentralized file sharing networks replace Napster, Ek came up with the idea for a company he’d eventually name Spotify:</p><p>Today P2P file sharing <a href="https://www.plagiarismtoday.com/2017/06/01/the-long-slow-decline-of-bittorrent/">has significantly declined</a>. But make no mistake: the digital piracy revolution moved industries. It forced music and film to cater to a digital-first world and eventually incentivized the invention of web streaming. The companies that didn’t adapt are now footnotes in history. Those that did will get to build the media dynasties of the next decade.</p><p>If you listen to Lawrence Lessig or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Sunde">Peter Sunde</a>, it’s easy to assume the file sharing revolution was rooted in ideology. But few file sharing veterans are still committed to piracy today. Trying to explain file sharing by appealing to intellectual property reform is like trying to explain the Boston Tea Party by appealing to John Locke. Ideology, while important, is usually post hoc.</p><p>The real story is much simpler than that.</p><p>The file sharing revolution took off because people opposed a rule: <em>you can only consume music how the record industry says you can</em>.</p><p>People hated this rule. So they broke it. And P2P protocols enabled this great, overwhelming mob of rule breakers to demonstrate the way they thought music ought to work.</p><p>Today, music works that way. No matter where you are, by doing a search and double clicking, you can listen to almost any song ever created.</p><p>Simon Morris claims this was the raison d’être of BitTorrent, and of decentralized networks more generally. Decentralization allows rules to be broken. And when a rule is opposed widely and strongly enough, people will build the technology to break that rule, and that technology will spread.</p><p>So why did ICOs need to be decentralized? Why couldn’t the bubble have kicked off through equity-backed blockchain startups like in the dotcom bubble?</p><p>To Simon Morris, the answer is obvious: because ICOs were not just about the chance to invest in speculative blockchain projects. They were also about breaking rules: <strong>the rules around capital formation.</strong></p><p>This begs the question, why do people want to break the rules around capital formation so badly?</p><p>The answer is complicated.</p><p>Consider the initial conditions of the ICO bubble. The bubble was primarily driven by countries in Asia with high savings rates and income inequality — China, Japan, and Korea. Over the last decade, we’ve seen income inequality rising, declines in wage growth for the global middle class, waning trust in governments, and a mass of overeducated young people with shrinking opportunities.</p><p>The ICO bubble was a loud rattling of this cage.</p><p>The most massive wealth creation events in the world took place over the last decade — but it all went to other people. <strong>You</strong> didn’t get any. This new wave of technology has subjugated your digital life and attention span, but its fruits belong to the capitalists in Silicon Valley, not you.</p><p>The ICO bubble let young people convince themselves: hey, maybe I can get my share. I see this Bitcoin thing, I see this Ethereum thing, they’re so novel and revolutionary, why couldn’t they change the world?</p><p>And wouldn’t they get just a little convinced that for once, they were a step ahead of their parents, ahead of the gatekeepers, ahead of Wall Street and Silicon Valley?</p><p>So they got in early. They started using VPNs. They got friends and family to create overseas accounts. They broke the rules. And what were those rules good for anyway, besides <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/01/29/most-americans-believe-the-economy-is-rigged-to-favor-the-rich-poll/">rigging the system for the rich</a>? Why couldn’t anyone in the world invest in whatever they wanted? Who needs disclosures anyway, if the future is going to be open source?</p><p>The market kept proving them right. So they speculated, they joined Subreddits and debated ideas and convinced themselves that their investments would revolutionize the world’s infrastructure. A decentralized future was fast approaching, and they were going to be, for once, at the vanguard ushering it in.</p><p>And of course, when reality finally caught up, it showed them the consequences of breaking those rules. 2018 brought everything crashing down, laying bare all the scams, frauds, and widespread market manipulation. A once ecstatic market flattened out like a pancake.</p><p>And here we must also acknowledge the other side of the market: entrepreneurs. To them, ICOs represented a great equalizer. After all, ICOs were dispersed internationally, and venture capital is still hard to come by outside of Silicon Valley. In the age of the Internet, in the age of blockchain, why hadn’t technology already leveled the playing field? Why should it matter where an entrepreneur lived or what language they spoke, so long as they knew the language of programming?</p><p>With ICOs, you didn’t need an intro to Sequoia to get your company started. Now you simply needed a good idea and a white paper, and the world’s capital would beat a path to your door.</p><p>Remember all the stories of <a href="http://fortune.com/2018/01/10/crypto-disrupt-venture-capital/">VCs quaking in their Patagonia vests</a>, worried that they were being displaced?</p><p>And then there were the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reverse-ico.asp">reverse ICOs</a>, where established companies ICOed their own token, as in the case of <a href="https://kinecosystem.org/">Kik</a> or <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/south-korea-chat-giant-will-launch-ico-new-blockchain-drive-report/">Kakao</a>. This is perfect if you want to fund an internal blockchain-related initiative, but skip all the burdensome overhead of shareholder protections or revenue generation.</p><p>Even among startups funded by Y Combinator, the hottest accelerator in the world, I heard reports that a startling number of them were pondering ICOs. Even Silicon Valley elite wanted to break the rules! In this case, they wanted a way out of their illiquid startup ownership, and speculators were all too happy to provide it to them.</p><p>It was only in retrospect that they would each realize why these rules were there in the first place. Once again, crypto relearned the lessons that traditional finance had long ago internalized.</p><p>Let’s grant that the ICO bubble was instigated by a desire to break the rules around capital formation. Today, with the dust having settled and the ICO bubble now an awkward memory, we can reexamine its battle cries with more clarity.</p><p>Did people really care about changing the rules around capital formation? Did they really care about democratizing investing access? Did they really care about reforming accredited investor laws, financial disclosures and AML/KYC requirements?</p><p>Many intellectual commentators <a href="https://messari.substack.com/p/securities-law-and-crypto-unqualified">rallied</a> <a href="https://vinnylingham.com/democratizing-crypto-investing-133f3108ecb6">against</a> <a href="http://averagejoecrypto.com/crypto-accredited-investors-fix-rules/">these</a> during the run-up, but this too was probably just part of the frenzy of revolution. I don’t see much clamoring for this in 2019.</p><p>As for the file sharing revolution — copyright law is, for all intents and purposes, mostly intact 20 years later.</p><p>So what does the file sharing revolution tell you about the ICO bubble?</p><p>First, it tells you that you should not take ideology at its word. The underlying causes of revolutions are usually more pragmatic than they appear.</p><p>It also explains the supply side for ICOs, companies that wanted to circumvent traditional channels for capital formation, and the demand side, individuals who were desperate to get access to high-growth speculative investments. Once the incentive to break the rules has waned, the revolution is likely to stop. That is precisely what we’ve seen in both file sharing and in ICOs.</p><p>But there’s another, darker side to explaining the ICO bubble — as an enabler of fraud, manipulation, and gambling. For this, we turn to our second historical model: the penny stock boom of the 90s.</p><p>Balaji Srinivasan once claimed that tokens would turn blockchains into the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/05/balaji-srinivasan-21-co-interview-on-blockchain.html">world’s biggest stock market</a>. This may someday be true — but for now, it seems that blockchains have become the world’s biggest penny stock market instead.</p><p>The term “penny stock” evokes images of shady stockbrokers in boiler rooms, and for good reason. You’ll remember Jordan Belfort, the protagonist of the 2013 film Wolf of Wall Street, made his fortune hustling as a penny stock broker.</p><p>Penny stocks are defined differently in different countries, but in the US, a penny stock is a stock issued by a small company that trades below $5 a share (originally it was stocks that traded below $1, but inflation and all). They are generally quoted <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otc.asp">OTC</a> and seldom trade on national exchanges. They have low liquidity, little public information, and are not required to make significant financial disclosures.</p><p>As such, they are plagued with fraud.</p><p>The legal designation of penny stocks began after the 1929 stock market crash, which subsequently triggered the Great Depression. It was believed that the crash was partially caused by unbridled speculation on penny stocks, and this led to the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/seact1934.asp">Securities Exchange Act of 1934</a> designating legal restrictions on penny stock trading.</p><p>Throughout most of the 20th century, penny stock offerings could not legally be placed in newspapers. Orders could only be placed via telephone. The highest quality penny stocks would only provide financial reporting once a year, and the very worst penny stocks had no financial disclosures at all. Given these barriers, penny stocks tended not to receive much attention.</p><p>But starting in the mid-90s with the growth of the Internet, penny stock trading exploded. Discount brokers emerged, offering automated interfaces and much lower trading fees. As retail investors flooded in, the space grew faster than regulators could track it, and market manipulation became rampant.</p><p>Eventually, the SEC stepped in and brought a string of <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/ts142000.htm">high profile cases</a>against Mafia crime families for penny stock manipulation schemes. All of these schemes were ultimately enabled by the Internet: it accelerated the velocity of fraud and allowed bad actors to connect directly with speculators.</p><p>Penny stock trading has been brought back under stricter regulatory oversight, but it’s still extremely speculative, and manipulation is common. In 1989, the heyday of penny stocks, a survey found that Americans had been cheated out of <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1989-09-08/business/fi-1942_1_penny-stock">at least $2B a year</a> by fraudulent penny stock schemes.</p><p>There’s an obvious parallel here with the ICO bubble.</p><p>The SATIS group estimated that <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/news/80-icos-are-scams-report/">81% (!) of ICOs were scams</a> and it’s been widely reported that over <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/news/beware-9m-are-lost-each-day-crypto-scams/">$9M was stolen per day in 2018</a> (annualized, that would be upwards of $3B a year). By sheer number, the overwhelming majority of ICOs can be explained this way. But the parallel between ICOs and penny stocks runs deeper.</p><p>Let’s take a step back here and ask: why are people so drawn to penny stocks in the first place, given how fraught they are?</p><p>As a former professional poker player, I can tell you the answer is simple: people love to gamble. Humans will forever be drawn to the idea of turning around their fortunes, of outsmarting the establishment, of skipping steps on the social ladder. No matter how much gambling is stigmatized, regulated, or outlawed, it always survives one way or another.</p><p>For penny stocks, they tap into the same greedy credulity behind all get rich quick schemes. It hardly matters what the underlying company does.</p><p>But we must also acknowledge the other side of this market: the hustlers and fraudsters. To them, penny stocks are a gift. And they also don’t care what the stocks represent — they simply need a company with a ticker and story to manipulate. Greed takes care of the rest.</p><p>Reminding you of anything?</p><p>Here’s a telling <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Internet-Makes-Stock-Scams-Easy-Pump-and-dump-2772185.php">article published in 2000</a> on common Internet penny stock pump and dump schemes. Let’s contrast it to ICOs.</p><p>The modern version: hiring an <a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-top-21-icomarketing-agencies-pr-firms-ab3d41e279c9">ICO marketing agency</a>, which will manage your Telegram chat, Subreddit, Medium account, and BitcoinTalk thread.</p><p>Don’t have a real community? No problem, buy a fake one.</p><p>How about a “hyper-scalable” “quantum-resistant protocol” for “supply chain management”? Getting some credentialed advisors to praise your protocol? Maybe rumored partnerships with a couple Fortune 100 companies?</p><p>(many of these examples are drawn from <a href="https://bitfalls.com/2018/01/12/anatomy-pump-dump-group/">Anatomy of a Pump &amp; Dump Group</a>)</p><p>You know the jig. Bounties, referral bonuses, airdrops, presales, advisor shares, purchased reviews, paid followers, social media bots, wash trading, painting TA signals, and so on. By the time the ICO boom had gone mainstream, this procedure was a well-oiled machine.</p><p>Most of the long tail of ICOs — and that tail was very long — were complete nonsense. According to most trackers, the total number of ICOs was well into the thousands, and that’s only counting those that were able to rise above the noise.</p><p>And like each penny stock boom before it, the ICO boom ended in <a href="https://www.virtualcurrencyreport.com/category/b-enforcement-actions/">multiple regulatory actions</a> against the worst offenders. But regulators can’t reach everyone, and most of the pump and dumpers either moved on or continue to manipulate coins at smaller scales.</p><p>ICOs, just as penny stocks, are a two-sided market. Speculators don’t care about the technology, they just want tickers to bet on and get rich. Fraudsters don’t care either, they just want tickers to manipulate and get rich. Everyone gets what they need, the market bustles with activity, and everyone makes money — until they don’t.</p><p>If you think about it, global, uncensorable blockchains are basically the optimal platform for another penny stock boom. It’s no wonder that bad actors and speculators were quick to converge on it. But despite the technological accoutrements, it’s an old story.</p><p>So what do penny stocks explain about the ICO bubble? Penny stocks explain the shitcoins, the scams, the unregistered securities, the market manipulation, and most of the long tail of the ICO bubble. Again, by volume, this is <em>most</em> of what was happening in the bubble.</p><p>But I want to be careful here. Penny stock fraudsters were quick to co-opt ICOs, but the concept of an ICO didn’t begin that way. ICOs arose out of blockchain community crowdfunding, first pioneered by <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2017/09/21/heres-the-man-who-created-icos-and-this-is-the-new-token-hes-backing/#16058fb21183">Mastercoin</a> in 2013, with <a href="https://www.coinmama.com/guide/history-of-ethereum">Augur</a> being the first ICO on Ethereum in 2015. Most of their investors were nerdy cypherpunks, excited to support some new technology they could play with.</p><p>We should not conflate cryptocurrencies, the underlying technology, with the ICO bubble, which was a speculative phenomenon that converged atop it. <strong>The ICO bubble was something that happened to crypto, not something intrinsic to it.</strong></p><p>Most of the technologists and cypherpunks who built this stuff were simply motivated by building a new financial system. And they’re still whittling away, even after the thundering herd of speculators and fraudsters have come and gone.</p><p>So we’ve looked at P2P file sharing and penny stocks in comparison to the ICO bubble. But there’s still one aspect of the bubble that I’ve failed to address so far — technological innovation.</p><p>After all, I don’t believe for a second that the crypto boom was principally about defrauding people, or that its underlying technology was irrelevant. The very opposite — the ICO bubble occurred atop the kindling of real technological innovation. To fully understand this, we have to turn to the last historical precedent: the dotcom bubble and its soothsayer, Carlota Perez.</p><p>The World Wide Web — the Internet as most people know it — was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989. Its invention was the spark that set off the Information Age, and alongside it, the greatest stock market bubble of this generation.</p><p>Compared to the technologies that came before it, the Web evolved rapidly. The Internet only had 2% penetration in the US when the Mosaic browser launched in 1993. Six years later, at the height of the bubble, a full <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/IT.NET.USER.ZS?locations=US">36% of the US was online</a>. (Telephones took <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/technology-adoption-by-households-in-the-united-states?time=1903..2016">more than 30 years</a> to reach the same level of penetration.)</p><p>The rapid rise of the Web, combined with low interest rates and the Clinton tax cuts of 1997, led to an incredible bullishness around the growth potential of the Internet. Venture capital became cheap and opportunistic. Entrepreneurs flocked to Silicon Valley.</p><p>Netscape, the company that built the Web’s most dominant web browser, kicked off the age. Netscape IPOed for $2.9B in 1995. It was somewhat unusual for an unprofitable company to IPO so successfully, but Netscape’s revenues were growing so rapidly that this would soon be forgotten.</p><p>The Netscape IPO would be quickly followed in 1996 by Yahoo!, Excite, and Lycos, all fantastically successful IPOs by companies that were also growing rapidly. And though, like Netscape, they were burning through cash, it didn’t seem to matter. Internet companies had become anointed.</p><p>Any company, so long as it had a “.com” in the name, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dotcom-bubble.asp">attracted huge valuations</a>. Investors pulled money out of slower-growth companies to plow more capital into dotcoms. Retail investors, having recently received tax rebates, piled in. The Internet itself became the interface for many investors, through platforms like E-Trade (which also IPOed in 1996). Many publications reported stories of white collar professionals <a href="http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,991726,00.html">quitting their jobs to daytrade tech stocks full-time</a>.</p><p>In just five years, the NASDAQ had risen more than 400%. This fomented an all-out frenzy. In 1999 alone, Qualcomm <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/03/business/the-year-in-the-markets-1999-extraordinary-winners-and-more-losers.html">26X’d its stock price</a>. Analysts stopped emphasizing P/E ratios and began citing Metcalfe’s Law. A WSJ article from 1999 posed the question: are profits just a “<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB9270768713268007">quaint concept</a>” that doesn’t matter anymore? The Super Bowl in January of 2000 featured no fewer than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_commercials_during_Super_Bowl_XXXIV">16 dotcom commercials</a>.</p><p>Companies like Pets.com were going from incorporation to IPO in a single year. Almost every single IPO popped, with an average of <a href="https://money.cnn.com/1999/12/27/investing/century_ipos/">68% first-day gains</a>. Investing in tech IPOs was widely agreed to be a foolproof way to multiply your money. A phenomenon of <a href="https://www.salon.com/2000/04/25/party_5/">dotcom parties</a> spread across the valley, and those close to founders often received “friends and family” shares as tokens of generosity.</p><p>It was a time of excess. The trend was baffling to Wall Street, to the East Coast elites, to the old money. Storied hedge funds like Tiger Management <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/31/business/the-end-of-the-game-tiger-management-old-economy-advocate-is-closing.html">went under</a>, unable to keep up with the shifting market structure. But the techies — they knew it all along, they told themselves.</p><p>The Internet would change everything.</p><p>On March 10 of 2000, the NASDAQ would hit its peak. The first tremor of weakness was on April 14, likely triggered by a tax selloff. By the end of that week, the NASDAQ tumbled a staggering 25%.</p><p>Soon, dotcoms realized that their burn rates were unsustainable. The Fed announced plans to aggressively raise interest rates, and the economy would see six such tightenings over the next several months. Capital wavered.</p><p>By May 18th, Boo.com went bust. In November, Pets.com followed. A few months later, Webvan shuttered operations. The show came crashing down faster than it had started, and funding had all but vanished. By the end of 2001, after the September 11 attacks, most publicly traded dotcoms went bankrupt. Trillions of dollars of investment capital had evaporated.</p><p>The ensuing recession would last several years. It wouldn’t be until 2004 when the first major post-crash dotcom company, Google, would IPO again.</p><p>Its first day pop was 18%.</p><p>With hindsight we can say that investing in the Internet was clearly right. It’s obvious how dramatically the Internet has changed the world. And yet the dotcom bubble seemed to have veered off somewhere terribly wrong.</p><p>What happened? Why couldn’t people at the time see it? And what can it teach us about the ICO bubble?</p><p>To understand the dotcom bubble, we have to start with Carlota Perez.</p><p>Carlota Perez is the patron saint of venture capitalists. Her seminal work, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Technological-Revolutions-Financial-Capital-Dynamics/dp/1843763311"><em>Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital</em></a> has been been cited by <a href="http://fortune.com/2014/02/13/marc-andreessen-tech-is-recovering-from-a-depression/">Marc Andreessen</a> and <a href="https://avc.com/2015/02/the-carlota-perez-framework/">Fred Wilson</a> as pivotal to their understanding of the tech industry.</p><p>I won’t do her book justice here, but I’ll attempt to summarize the key ideas that are relevant to both the dotcom crash and the ICO bubble. I’ll be quoting heavily from Carlota herself.</p><p>Carlota Perez subscribes to the long wave economic cycle theory, known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kondratiev_wave">Kondratiev Waves</a>, in which technological innovation occurs in 45–60 year waves.</p><p>According to Perez, these innovation waves consist of three phases:</p><p><strong>Installation</strong> is the period when a new technology is first explored, installed, and then speculated on. This speculation leads to an unsustainable asset bubble and a spectacular <strong>collapse</strong>. Then a more sober period of <strong>deployment</strong>takes place, during which the technology matures and sustainably alters many aspects of society. After a full deployment cycle has exhausted its economic growth, a new technology initiates a new innovation wave, and the cycle begins anew.</p><p>The same general shape can be observed in each cycle.</p><p>Each of these revolutions was kicked off by a seminal project that would catalyze the technology — the industrial revolution with Arkwright’s Cromford mill, the steam and railway age with the Liverpool-Manchester Railway, the steel and heavy engineering age with Carnegie’s Bessemer steel plant, the age of automobiles with Ford’s assembly line, and the computer age with Intel’s 4004 microprocessor.</p><p>By this model, the moment that kicked off ICO bubble must be the launch of Ethereum. Ethereum was not the first cryptocurrency, but it was the first ICO to produce astronomical returns, and it would set the foundation for the frenzy that was to come. Ethereum launched in 2015, exactly 44 years after the Intel 4004 in 1971.</p><p>What does she mean by “techno-economic paradigm”?</p><p>Simply put, a techno-economic paradigm is a new accepted way of doing things. When a new technology takes form and begins driving innovation, it brings with it a new logic of how businesses should be structured. For example, with the advent of the automobile, the paradigm encouraged businesses to adopt mass production, economies of scale, and standardized products for mass marketing appeal — the logic of the factory. In this paradigm, every American should own not just a mass-produced automobile, but also a TV, a refrigerator, a washing machine, etc.</p><p>As a techno-economic paradigm <a href="https://i.imgur.com/ywCcYxa.png">becomes ascendant</a>, any entrepreneur who does not subscribe to the new paradigm will be seen as low-status and behind the times.</p><p>We know the techno-economic paradigm of the late internet revolution: move fast and break things, launch MVPs, iterate in short cycles, pursue business models with zero marginal cost. Basically all the mantras consumed today by aspiring tech founders.</p><p>Cast in these terms, the techno-economic paradigm of crypto is almost embarrassing to say out loud. Here’s what we taught founders about how to build a business in the crypto age:</p><p>Basically, cargo culting the Ethereum ICO—the same way dotcoms cargo culted Netscape.</p><p>In the ICO bubble, founders who deviated from this paradigm were seen as low-status, opportunistic, “not getting crypto,” and were thus less rewarded in their fundraises. Yet in hindsight, almost none of this was predictive of an entrepreneur’s long-term success.</p><p>Keep the dotcom crash in the back of your mind. For now, I’m going to focus entirely on how Perez’s account of financial bubbles comports with the ICO bubble.</p><p>In the frenzy, new millionaires are minted. They try to multiply their wealth in the same way they made it, redeploying their capital to generate more profits. The gap between paper values and real values widens, and the newly rich come to believe that their newfound wealth is due to superior insight and intuition.</p><p>Dismantles institutional frameworks, check. Overinvests in new infrastructure, check. Invents new instruments for financial speculation (ICOs, SAFTs, SAFTEs), check.</p><p>Do you remember being told by Uber drivers to invest in BAT or IOTA? Do you remember the New York Times article, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/13/style/bitcoin-millionaires.html">Everyone is Getting Hilariously Rich and You’re Not</a>?</p><p>Perez recalls a quote by Bruce Nussbaum about the dotcom bubble:</p><p>Do you remember the nonsensical projects? The teams that no one had heard of? The copy and pasted white papers? All the shameless rhetoric about 10 trillion dollar TAMs and 100K transactions per second?</p><p>Do you remember all the ICO investing syndicates? The Telegram groups? The newsletters?</p><p>During Canal Mania in the 1790s, canals were created from river to river with no regard for routing, believing that canals magically produced demand. In the 1840s, railway projects were built from town to town without regard for engineering practicality. In the 1920s, real estate values became untethered from the constraints of urban planning, believing that the automobile meant any territory could be valuable if connected by roads. And of course, in the late 90s, dotcoms were funded with no evidence of product-market fit.</p><p>None of this is new.</p><p>And of course, do you remember all the voices (<a href="https://medium.com/dash-for-newbies/crypto-the-dawn-of-the-single-greatest-wealth-transfer-in-the-history-of-mankind-bc7683ad4c">rejoicing</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/RyanSAdams/status/1052566485200199681">lamenting</a>) the new redistribution of wealth?</p><p>The ICO bubble was simply a variation on the theme. The players and the tactics were different, but the human stories were the same. Like in the dot com bubble there were, as always, stories of overnight millionaires, flagrant scams, manifestos declaring a new technological order, levered debts and second mortgages that ended in catastrophe — all the usual roil and ruin of speculative manias.</p><p>All this is to say, we’ve seen this before.</p><p>Crypto’s gilded age is probably now over. Most of those newly minted millionaires have unwittingly surrendered their riches. The hype has died away, ICO funding has dried up, <a href="http://fortune.com/2018/11/02/sec-ico-report-cryptocurrency-scams/">SEC enforcement actions</a> are trickling in, and the media’s crush on crypto has passed.</p><p>But, Perez reminds us, the frenzy phase and subsequent crash is not merely painful — it is necessary to any technological revolution. The financial casino attracts the funds necessary to install basic infrastructure and facilitate social learning.</p><p>Without the dotcom bubble, there would not have been all of the investments into optical fiber buildouts, ISPs and internet infrastructure, packet-switched networks for telecoms, and all the competition overs consumers that would ultimately galvanize internet adoption. We needed that social and technological foundation in place for the Internet to flourish.</p><p>Perez’s book was written in 2003 during the nadir of the dotcom crash, and she presciently situates the Internet within her K-wave framework. History has proven her right.</p><p>But we should be careful not to invert her thesis: she claims that all technological revolutions induce a bubble, but that does not mean all bubbles are induced by technological revolutions. Indeed, most aren’t. It remains to be seen which camp crypto falls into.</p><p>So what does Perez explain about the ICO bubble?</p><p>She explains the logic of frenzy, the stoking of financial capital, and the rhetoric of paradigm shifts (“all companies will become decentralized”). She explains the influx of retail investors (“widows and orphans”), traditional financial capital piling in at dizzying prices (Telegram, Filecoin, Hashgraph), and the flood of traditional entrepreneurs contorting themselves to follow the new paradigm.</p><p>In the end, we should count ourselves lucky that the ICO bubble was not as destructive as the dotcom bubble. About $15B were raised by ICOs in 2017–2018, but that’s a drop in the bucket compared to all of venture capital, which deployed around <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/q4-2018-closes-out-a-record-year-for-the-global-vc-market/">$500B during the same period</a>. And the ICO crash was not nearly as destabilizing as the dotcom bubble. When all is said and done, the dotcom bubble wiped out about $5 trillion of value and was much more concentrated in the United States. Losses in the ICO bubble were ~15% of that, absorbed across many more economies, and during a time of relative economic prosperity. (Also, we should be cautious <a href="https://medium.com/@RainDogDance/bitcoin-as-a-novel-market-institution-nic-carter-talk-at-baltic-honeybadger-2018-e085f163b213">when conflating the “market cap” of crypto with the NASDAQ</a>.)</p><p>The ICO bubble had no single cause. Mono-causal explanations always fall short in explaining complex phenomena. But its effects are easier to pinpoint.</p><p>There are now many world class teams well-capitalized to build, scale, and evolve blockchain technology, and tens of millions of people in the world who now understand decentralization, proof of work, and private keys. Looking back, it’s really quite amazing! It comes at a high cost, but Perez hints: it’s likely that bubbles like these are the only way to overcome technological inertia.</p><p>At the same time, most people had their first interaction with crypto during its orgiastic adolescence. It’s not a great look. But this has been true for every technological revolution of the last 250 years. In that regard, crypto is in good company.</p><p>I was too young to appreciate the dot com bubble when it happened. It’s strange to say, but I’m glad to have witnessed a speculative bubble from up close. I’ve now got war stories to share with future generations. It was a wild time, when anyone in the world could launch a coin and raise tens of millions of dollars to build a network that no one could control. I don’t think we’ll see anything like that again for a long time.</p><p>So what happens now?</p><p>If you believe that crypto has the stuff of a technological revolution, then as Perez puts it, the collapse will pave the way for a more fruitful deployment phase. At the end of the day, I’m an optimist about technology. So it won’t surprise you that I think this deployment phase is coming. But it will be slow, unglamorous, and probably won’t make for nearly as entertaining of headlines.</p><p>Oh well.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>There are multiple paths to constructing a piece of software from start to finish. </p><p>An individual programmer can build an entire product from scratch in a couple days. A giant corporation can commission a project and delegate responsibilities to hundreds of people. An open source community can use the wisdom of the crowds to efficiently build an operating system.</p><p>Today’s episode is about another path for building software, and my own experience traveling that path. I designed and contracted an app called Adforprize that is now available on the iOS app store.</p><p>Designing an app and contracting it out to an engineer to build is a worthwhile exercise for most people in the tech industry–whether you are an engineer or not.</p><p>This post has two main arguments:</p><p>As with the previous monologue episodes such as <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2016/02/12/10-philosophies-for-developers/">10 Philosophies for Engineers</a> and <a href="http://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2016/08/07/you-are-not-a-commodity/">You Are Not a Commodity</a>, there are no advertisements on this episode. Please email me any feedback you have–jeff@softwareengineeringdaily.com</p><p>Everyone has an app idea, and many of them are pretty good. </p><p>You have probably had a conversation with a friend where one of you says “hey, wouldn’t it be great if there was a 2-sided marketplace for bacon?” Or “hey, wouldn’t it be great if there was an app where users could take a selfie and instantly see what celebrity they resemble the most?”</p><p>These things would be cool! But most ideas end with the ideation. </p><p>Who has the time to implement these things? Most of us are busy at<br>\nwork, where we spend our time and mental energy dealing with the technical complexity of our jobs.</p><p>If you are a “<a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/28/the-google-formula-for-success/?_r=0">smart creative</a>”, when you get home from your job, you probably don’t want to spend your leisure hours reading iOS documentation and slowly learning to write the necessary code for your bacon marketplace app.<br>\n</p><p>Smart creatives who have a busy full-time job often have a hobby with more immediate gratification, like playing an instrument or blogging. Some of us also write apps on the side, but if you don’t already have all the requisite skills for writing an app, the prospect of reading tutorials and documentation can make the feeling of ever publishing an app seem so distant.</p><p><br>\nThere are many people listening to this who are<br>\nbetter at sales, marketing, design, or product management than they are at programming–they want to build an app. One common narrative is that if these people want to see something built, they need to learn to program, and that’s not true.</p><p><br>\nThere is a more fun, fulfilling way to build an app than learning to code in Swift or React Native–contracting out the programming to someone else.</p><p>Designing an app is a fun exercise. Building a prototype with tools like Sketch, InVision, and Keynote is free and frictionless. Most people listening to this probably spent some time drawing in KidPix or Microsoft Paint or PhotoShop when they were a kid. </p><p>Most of us know how to draw at some basic level, because we spend all</p><p>day seeing and understanding images–drawing is second nature to anyone who can understand shapes. Similarly, we all know how to design apps because we spend all day using them. We understand the purpose of a button or a slider or a swipe.</p><p>But most of us have no idea how to configure the code around this user experience–the buttons and sliders and TextViews.</p><p>Along with the design process,   the business ideation process is also fun. It’s fun to imagine business models and viral loops and ways to drive user engagement. But without the capability to build the app that embodies your business ideas, it is less fun to think about those ideas. And again–most of us don’t relish the idea of struggling through the compiler errors and Stack Overflow posts that an app implementation requires.</p><p>We’ve all become product designers. We are using our phones all day–most of us have naturally developed a good intuition for how an app should function.</p><p>Product design ability is naturally acquired by being steeped in technology all day. If you are an employee in marketing, sales, or design (and certainly engineering) at a tech company, you will naturally learn how to think about product.</p><p>Importantly: you probably even have a few good product ideas yourself!</p><p>This article is about why and how to prototype your own ideas and communicate your intent as a product designer–which is an incredibly fun process.</p><p>If you can afford it, you can then hand off your prototype to a contractor for engineering implementation.</p><p>Working at a tech company, you might have accumulated some excess cash. You can invest that $5,000 that you have sitting around by contracting a product in your spare time. This can be a much better investment than something like stocks or ETFs, and it is more satisfying and durable than taking an expensive vacation. </p><p>The experience of contracting a product teaches you skills that might not be stressed in your 9-5 job: management, product design, user experience, budgeting, communications, and engineering limitations.</p><p>The first version of Uber was written by a contractor. The Uber founders clearly communicated the specification for their product to the contractor, and they got what they asked for.</p><p>Contracting Uber was easy for the founders. They had millions of dollars from their earlier startups, they had a network of contractors to choose from, and they had experience hiring people.</p><p>There is now a set of technologies that are enabling this for the average person.</p><p>The last point deserves further emphasis. Cool new apps are often interesting remixes of well-defined mechanics.</p><p>Mechanics such as newsfeeds, likes, photo sharing, map-based ride-sharing overlays, swiping interfaces, and social media integration are a palette of interesting ingredients that have lots of new-product mileage left.</p><p>These types of features are so widely used that their implementation is well-understood and documented. You don’t need to find an expensive contractor who specializes in swiping or newsfeed architecture–you will be paying a reasonable market rate.</p><p>Programming ability is not a prerequisite for being a good product designer and operator.</p><p>And yet–the negative term “wantrepreneur” is used to describe someone who has ideas but has not built/shipped anything substantive. If you listen to <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/podcasts">Silicon Valley type of podcasts</a>, you will occasionally hear a venture capitalist or angel investor use the word. </p><p>It’s offensive and shame-inducing and should be removed from our lexicon. </p><p>But–it does accurately describe many people in the tech industry (albeit in a condescending and discouraging manner). Oftentimes, this same type of person wants to know what to do if they cannot find a “technical co-founder” (someone to build and iterate on a product). </p><p>Contemporary product development literature mostly advises against contracting, but it can be a good strategy if you have a product idea you really want to get out the door into the hands of users.</p><p>The conventional reasoning against hiring a contractor to build your product (and why it is mistaken):</p><p>In today’s tech scene, there are tons of people without the ability to code who nonetheless have excellent product design abilities.</p><p>Whether you are in sales, marketing, or customer service, if you want to build a product someday, or even if you just want to move from your current role to a role in product management or design–consider designing and prototyping an app, and having a contractor build it.</p><p>If you have specific ideas for what you want built, and you have some extra cash lying around, contracting an experimental app is awesome.</p><p>There are plenty of programmers whose job roles do not require them to think about product design.</p><p>I spent three years engineering backend Java systems, and there was rarely an interesting decision to be made about the end user’s experience with the product itself. It was all about implementation. </p><p>You can spend a whole career like this, never grappling with problems higher up the stack. If you are planning to do that, then you will make a lot of money–why not spend $5k of it delegating an app to a contractor?</p><p>You might find out that you love product design and development even more than backend engineering.</p><p>I’ve been thinking about contracting an app ever since I heard the story of Uber’s prototype. More recently, <a href="http://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2015/11/18/software-and-entrepreneurship-with-seth-godin/">when Seth Godin came on this podcast</a>, I asked him about the engineering challenges of building Squidoo, the second company he sold. As it turns out, the minimum viable product for Squidoo was also written by a contractor.</p><p>My biggest takeaways from that brief discussion with Seth: have your deliverables as well-defined as possible and you won’t have to iterate in order to get the product out the door as you imagined it in your head.</p><p>The Uber and Squidoo examples are interesting because Kalanick and Godin both studied computer science, but they still opted not to write their apps. They decided the work would be done faster and more effectively if they delegated.</p><p>As an engineer, I have been building janky minimum viable products for the last five years because I assumed that was the way it had to be done. Each time I designed and built an app, the end result was unimpressive. Because I wasn’t focused entirely on the product design OR the engineering, I did a poor job trying to do both.</p><p>This is one of the most common fallacies that keeps programmers in a position where they have to take orders. </p><p>The programmer is conditioned to believe that delegating something means admitting that you are incapable of doing it. Programmers are taught that it is more valiant to spend hours reading documentation and doing something on your own than to delegate your work to someone who won’t have to read as much documentation, and will do it faster and more cleanly.</p><p>After hearing about several stories of contracted products that turned into successful companies, I decided to experiment with the contracting process myself. I would focus on product design and hire a contractor to write the software.</p><p>When we think of product designers, we often think of a bolt of inspiration coming to an inscrutable genius like Jack Dorsey or Steve Jobs or Elon Musk.</p><p>The reality is that effective product design can be learned by anyone who is willing to put in the hours, study the craft, and iterate. From Airbnb to Facebook to the wide range of products on IndieHackers.com–successful products come from people are constantly experimenting and toying around with new ideas.</p><p>A product designer lives and breathes research and development. The effective product designer is constantly studying the world and running experiments in her own life. She crafts her environment to be conducive to new ideas, and keeps her calendar peppered with blank space where she can reflect and let new ideas come to the surface of her consciousness. </p><p>I keep whiteboards around my apartment to write down product ideas and other fleeting moments of inspiration. </p><p>Back in college, I was on a diet of homemade Soylent and I was having awful fever dreams due to related indigestion. I had misread the recipe for Soylent that I found online, and had accidentally put three times the amount of fiber in my mixture as the recipe called for.</p><p>I woke up at 2 AM from these Soylent induced fever dreams. I have heard that people often think up their best ideas when they wake up at 2 AM, because the boundary between your consciousness and your unconsciousness retreats a little bit. </p><p>In this case, I was struck by an idea for a user-generated advertising platform, where companies would offer contests where people could compete to make the best ads. I sketched it on one of my whiteboards and went back to sleep for a few fitful hours.</p><p>When I woke up, I copied the idea from my whiteboard to a spiral notebook, and then forgot about it.</p><p>Years later, I was working at an advertising technology company, and I started to see some of the inefficiencies in the advertising industry. I realized that my idea from back in college might actually have merit. I started building a prototype called Banner Warhol, and I completed it in a few weeks. </p><p>Along the way, I seeded it with some fake ads I made (thanks to Michael Rosenthal and Josh Stewart for helping with the design).</p><p>This was a decent idea, but fraught with mistaken execution:</p><p>I didn’t know what I was building or why. I had a vague sense that user-generated advertising could be cool, and I started hacking on the idea without thinking further.</p><p>I have no professional experience writing front-end apps, and it shows with Banner Warhol. Consequently, the code base quickly became a disaster. I got sick of the project, and I quit: the classic abandoned side project.</p><p>As I said above, in this case the engineering was a distraction from thinking about the product. I was afraid to think too deeply about the product I wanted to build because I was afraid I wouldn’t be able to engineer it.</p><p>If you are trying to play both product designer and engineer, there can be inherent cognitive dissonance.</p><p>I abandoned the idea for a year and a half, going to work at Amazon and then focusing on building this podcast. </p><p>But–the idea of user-generated advertising has stuck with me, and when I read futurist Kevin Kelly talking about it in his recent book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Inevitable-Understanding-Technological-Forces-Future/dp/0525428089">The Inevitable</a> I knew there was something yet unexplored:</p><p>“With a peer-to-peer system, these ads would be created by passionate (and greedy) users and unleashed virally into the blog wilds, where the best ads would evolve by testing and redesign until they were effective.”</p><p>If you replace the word “blog”, with “social networking”, the idea for peer-to-peer advertising becomes quite compelling. Social networks are where advertising is most effective today–so the question became, how can you build user-generated advertising into the social network ecosystem?</p><p><a href="http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/taco-bells-cinco-de-mayo-snapchat-lens-was-viewed-224-million-times-171390">Snapchat has added features around user-generated advertising</a> and <a href="http://themobilemedialab.com/">Instagram models make deals with advertisers</a>. These ideas scratch the surface–but user-generated advertising is not just a feature, or an idea that you patent. It is an entire medium of expression. </p><p>We need an entire platform for making ads.</p><p>People should be able to make advertisements for products, ideas, and movements. They should be able to see each other’s advertisements, to Like and Comment on them, and connect with brands who want to use those advertisements. This would lower the cost to the brands who currently work with overpriced agencies to make their ad campaigns.</p><p>Armed with this hypothesis, I thought about the minimal way to run an experiment.</p><p>Who is a user base that is most likely to latch on to a product that lets you make ads? </p><p>I was thinking about this question when I was scrolling through Instagram and saw a cache of people who are making their own ads already–Instagram fitness instructors and models. </p><p>Many of these people are trying to build a personal brand, and in doing so they advertise for products like protein shakes, meal plans, and fitness programs. They may have 2000-5000 followers, which is respectable but not highly monetizable. Most big brands will not do business with this type of person.</p><p>Nonetheless, they are “influencer marketers”. This mid-level amount of “influence” is going largely uncaptured. It is like blogging before Google AdSense.</p><p>From Instagram to Vine to YouTube to Facebook, there exists the challenge of connecting influencers to brands they should be representing, but on Instagram this problem seemed most acute.</p><p>My idea for a workflow was:</p><p>It would have the familiar mechanics of a photo sharing app so that people felt like they were using something they had used before.</p><p>I took out a notebook and started drawing diagrammatic ideas. When I had the idea fleshed out on paper, I moved to Sketch, a Mac OS tool that is like Photoshop. Stitching together pictures from Google Images, I made the design as crisp as I could. </p><p>I had no prior experience with Sketch. It is an awesome piece of software and is more intuitive than I expected.</p><p>After creating screenshots for the workflows I wanted, I put together <a href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/PJ7L34OYF%23/screens/165342605">an Invision</a> to further describe the functionality of the app. Invision is a fantastic product for communicating UX and design.</p><p>I like Invision because it is easy to share your prototype. At Apple, product designers use Keynote to create prototypes that feel like apps, so that is a viable choice as well.</p><p>When I finished the prototype, I wanted to get it into the hands of users. But, I was working on Software Engineering Daily full-time. I already had a lot on myplate, so it was important that I used my spare time efficiently.</p><p>For a few weeks, I tried to learn modern iPhone programming. My pace of learning was so slow and I was not motivated by learning the syntax and the design patterns of mobile development. Thinking back to how Uber and Squidoo were made, I decided to contract my advertising platform–which I was then calling “Adstagram”.</p><p>I logged onto Upwork and searched for iOS developers with experience on photo sharing apps, quickly finding someone who was <a href="https://support.upwork.com/hc/en-us/articles/211063568-How-do-freelancers-become-Top-Rated-">top rated</a> and worked for $66/hour. I asked him for a demonstration of his work and he showed me a photo sharing app he had built in the past, which he could reuse some of his code from.</p><p>I sent him the prototype and asked him for a quote as well as a description for how he would build the app. His price was reasonable and the architecture he proposed was simple, so we got started with a first, simple set of milestones to hit.</p><p>As a software engineer, it was easier for me to evaluate that his estimations of time and cost were reasonable. If you are not an engineer, you can check with an engineer friend to see if what a contractor is offering you is fair.</p><p>Upwork creates an escrow transaction for each set of milestones you define. I defined milestones in terms of high-level functionality and capabilities that were a subcomponent of that functionality. </p><p>For example, the following list of user story functionality requirements could make up a milestone:</p><p>Each milestone was a small amount of money, and gave me a feel for the pace at which the contractor worked, and helped me predict what the final budget might be. After each milestone, he sent me a working version of the application thus far.</p><p>I was testing the app after each milestone, and this put me in the shoes of the user. During testing I identified an issue with an image search feature within the app. I made a flow chart in Gliffy to be clear about how I thought it should work.</p><p>Four months after initially contracting the app, the functionality is complete and the price tag is under budget–it took $3100 to build, and I gave the contractor a $400 bonus for doing a great job and being responsive. </p><p>You can now download Adforprize in the iOS app store. I use the app on a regular basis, and I’m looking forward to seeing how people respond to it. </p><p>If you have an iPhone, I would love if you checked it out, and if you like it then rate the app on the app store. I didn’t ask for ratings on the iTunes store very often for this podcast–because I’m not convinced ratings matter that much for podcasts. But they definitely matter for apps.</p><p>For many people, the most coveted job in tech right now is “product”, whether that means product design, product engineering, or both. </p><p>We dream about drawing something on a whiteboard in a conference room during a meeting, and then seeing a finished product come across our desk a week later, so we can evaluate it, critique it, and send it back for another iteration. </p><p>How do those whiteboarding product phenoms get such an awesome job? By practicing and getting good. Why else would anyone talented follow their lead? One way or another, these “product” people have accrued experience and are rewarded with responsibility.</p><p>Adforprize has gone from being Soylent-induced nightmare idea to a reality that you can download from the app store. Now begins the long, cyclical slog of getting people to try it out, realizing that numerous UX issues make it confusing and terrible, and paying a contractor for continued alterations. </p><p>My hope is that the app gets some traction, and it will make sense to hire someone full time to work on it. If Adforprize falls completely flat, and nobody cares about it–that’s OK too. I have had a ton of fun building it, and the education was worth twice the price. I’m happy to pay the cost of tuition.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Serverless computing reduces the cost of using the cloud. Serverless also makes it easy to scale applications. The downside: building serverless apps requires some mindset shift. Serverless functions are deployed to transient units of computation that are spun up on demand. This is in contrast to the typical model of application delivery–the deployment of an application to a server or a container that stays running until you shut it down.</p><p>Robin Weston develops large projects with AWS Lambda, and he joined me for a discussion of how to build applications for serverless environments and how to do continuous delivery with serverless functions. One big appeal for continuous delivery fans is that serverless deployments are often smaller–the user is deploying something as small as a function.</p><p>Full disclosure: ThoughtWorks GoCD is a sponsor of Software Engineering Daily.</p><p><a href="https://www.gocd.org/2017/06/26/serverless-architecture-continuous-delivery/">Serverless Architectures and Continuous Delivery by Robin Weston</a></p><p><a href="https://vimeo.com/channels/pipelineconf/209686484">Robin Weston at Pipeline Conf</a></p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>When an application is using all of its available resources, that application needs to be scaled. Scaling an application means giving it more resources–typically servers. Autoscaling is an engineering practice where an application is automatically given more or less resources based on how healthy the application performance is at a given time.</p><p>Applications on Heroku have access to autoscaling. Heroku users don’t need to worry about provisioning new servers manually because the platform does it for them. In this episode, we explore how Heroku built autoscaling.</p><p>Andrew Gwozdziewycz [@apgwoz] is an operational experience engineer with Heroku. As he describes, autoscaling requires frequent health checks of an application. Since thousands of applications are running on Heroku, a metrics pipeline using Kafka and Cassandra supports the high volume of health check data. That data feeds into the decision process for when an application needs to scale.</p><p>Full disclosure: Heroku is a sponsor of Software Engineering Daily.</p>',

Not only do you need to be highly available, consistent, and fast–you need to be PCI compliant. In this episode, we explore the infrastructure of Stripe with Evan Broder, who has been with the company for five years.</p><p>Stripe started as a small payments company catering to developers with a monolithic code base. Some of those aspects of Stripe have changed, and others have stayed the same.</p><p>In our last episode, we covered how observability works at Stripe. In this episode, we explore what is being observed–the actual infrastructure itself, and how different engineers are organized around managing the infrastructure. In tomorrow’s episode, we’ll talk to Michael Manapat, about Stripe’s machine learning pipeline for detecting and preventing fraudulent transactions.</p><p>Throughout these episodes, you will get a sense for how Stripe’s engineering culture works.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>The underlying cause of failure for many startups is that the founders are afraid of discomfort. An environment where everyone is comfortable is unlikely to be an environment where personal growth and value creation is occurring. </p><p>When you are in a startup, calibrating the right amount of discomfort is often about calibrating risk.</p><p>What are your risks? Can you quantify them? Can you enumerate them? Multiplying out the probability of surviving each of those risks, then multiplying that number times the sum of the discounted future cash flows of your business will give you the expected value of your business. </p><p>Under the right circumstances, entrepreneurship has much higher expected value than a stable engineering job. The important difference is variance. Your business needs to be able to withstand the variance that bad luck can provide. And entrepreneurs themselves need to be able to withstand the variance implied by the fact that their business can completely fail and go to zero.</p><p>Leo Polovets is a partner with Susa Ventures. He worked as an early engineer at Linkedin, Google, and Factual, and he blogs at <a href="http://codingvc.com">Coding VC</a>.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Following the successful experiment of <a href="http://softwaredaily.wpengine.com/2016/02/06/history-of-hadoop/">History of Hadoop</a>, we are doing another Saturday experiment: an editorial podcast.

It has no guest. It is a monologue editorial inspired by <a href="https://developertea.com">Developer Tea</a>.</p><p>Immutable laws are rare in software engineering, and when an engineer claims to have found one, that engineer is usually regarded with skepticism.</p><p>General principles are more welcome.</p><p>In this post and podcast episode, I convey some loose philosophies about modern software engineering. <a href="http://www.saffo.com/02008/07/26/strong-opinions-weakly-held/">These are strong opinions weakly held</a>. I welcome debate and discussion.</p><p>Software is a new field and nobody knows how to do it. If someone says you are unqualified and therefore you must do maintenance work, you should question that person. We have an upside down system where the people who are paid the least do the crappiest work. They tend to be young and naive.</p><p>This is not an axiom.</p><p>The narrative that is sold to young engineers by giant companies is the following: take your $80k/yr job, do the software maintenance which makes the company $1 million, and hate your life.</p><p>After you have spent enough time in the first tier of the intellectual strip mine, we will make you an SDE 2, where you can do slightly higher level refactoring for $150k a year, which will make the giant company $5 million. This is what is called an arbitrage.</p><p>We have an assembly line mindset left over from the industrial age. Software is more of an artisanship. Don’t believe that you are a replaceable cog. Don’t believe the one-size-fits-all interview process with whiteboarding problems. These serve to grind away your individuality and make you feel like an assembly line worker.</p><p>The planning and design process is an art, but once the requirements are in place you can proceed more deterministically. The same is true for the other quantitative activities I have taken part in–<a href="http://softwaredaily.wpengine.com/2015/10/23/poker-to-programming-with-haseeb-qureshi/">poker</a>, <a href="https://play.spotify.com/artist/7ypFFBJINZtKfxN7ez5ZVF">music</a>, and <a href="http://jeffmeyerson.com/">writing</a>. As <a href="http://softwaredaily.wpengine.com/2015/12/24/digital-nomadism-with-michael-rosenthal/">Michael Rosenthal and I discussed</a>, the question of art vs. science is the same question as strategy vs. tactics.</p><p><a href="http://qr.ae/ROqjtm">I learned this very early on playing poker when I had to leave that career</a>, and I had tightly coupled poker to my identity. If you make your job the same thing as who you are, then your self-worth is defined by those who are judging you in your job.</p><p>Your job is a means to service your own higher purpose.</p><p>When you take an action on your smartphone, there is latency before that action is ingested.</p><p>Servers sometimes will lie to you, but servers tend towards eventual consistency. The world works the same way. In the short term, human systems lie to us all the time, but the world tends toward eventual consistency–the truth eventually presents itself.</p><p>A decent analogy is the efficient market hypothesis: slowly efficient markets are an eventually consistent process.</p><p>The world is a distributed system–what is the consequence of this? We have to do the arduous risk and reward calculations that are mandatory for every distributed systems programmer.</p><p>Long-tail failures can and do occur.</p><p>In a distributed system, we often prioritize safety over liveness. In a distributed operating system, the programmer takes all precaution to avoid data loss. Similarly, if a real life scenario presents a small probability of giant downside risk, you should take huge precaution. If someone offers you to roll a die with 1000 sides, and if you roll a 1-999, you get $100 million, but if you roll a 1000, you get your head chopped off, the upside is capped, but the downside is not.</p><p>I can estimate how significantly $100 million will improve my life, but it is impossible to quantify how bad it is to get my head chopped off. I would almost never take that offer, because the expected value is infinitely negative.</p><p>Coming back to the consequences of living in a distributed system, there is a huge range of potential outcomes in a given transaction, and assessing these long tail, massive risks takes a lot of deep thought and calculation.</p><p>This is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZM_JmZdqCw">quote from Peter Thiel</a>. He argues that we should think in terms of calculus rather than statistics because if you believe the world is a lottery, then you will give yourself permission to lose.</p><p>Example: a software engineer might say “I am applying to a job with 1000 applicants, so the chances I will get the job are pretty low.” That is looking at a game of skill as a game of luck, and if you don’t optimize with lots of preparation and sleep for that interview, then it’s your own fault.</p><p>If you play poker or Magic or Dominion, it is easy to blame a loss on luck, but the best players are the ones who optimize in spite of bad luck. Personally, I like playing games under circumstances when I get unlucky because it makes for more of an interesting challenge and a better learning experience.</p><p>Luck is an idea that rescues us when we don’t do enough due diligence.</p><p>We live in a society that loves to talk about luck because it gives us an excuse when we lose. That is not to say that there isn’t luck in the world–<em>plenty</em> of people are unlucky. But if you are reading this, chances are you are in the luckiest .01%.</p><p>There is a long-running philosophical argument about whether or not we control our own fate. In actuality, it doesn’t really matter.</p><p>We should assume that we are in control of our own fate.</p><p>If we aren’t in control, it doesn’t change anything <em>whether or not </em>we assume that we are in control. But if we are in control, it would be very hazardous to our well being to assume that we are <em>not</em> in control.</p><p>Talk is cheap and execution is scarce.</p><p>This is why nobody cares about your ideas, they care about seeing your prototype. John Mayer said that all he had to do to become successful is <strong>finish</strong> his songs.</p><p>At Amazon, they called this “bias for action”. At Facebook, they “move fast and break things”.</p><p>That said, usually you can choose both. <a href="http://media.corporate-ir.net/media_files/irol/97/97664/reports/Shareholderletter97.pdf">Long-term planning is underrated</a> because few people take the aggressive short term actions necessary to iterate towards it. If you have never seen long-term planning bear fruits, it’s hard to see the point.</p><p>You have to figure out what to believe for yourself.</p><p>There are also lots of great people, but it is up to you to develop intuition and strong reasoning.</p><p>There is a scene from <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=4&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwinzOKcjPTKAhUW9mMKHaUEBrIQFghQMAM&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FThe_Big_Short_(film)&amp;usg=AFQjCNHSbTXdlVKAkKPKf8ah3g-AvP7R7A&amp;sig2=2HJpZDA_SRY-VRsrLs9drw">The Big Short</a> where Mark Baum, played by Steve Carrell, is standing in front of bankers saying “the world is full of fraud, our food is fraudulent, our banking system is fraudulent, our medicine is fraudulent”, and if you look around and investigate each of these things, you do find that these systems have layers of deception and lies–software engineering is the same.</p><p>For example, if you get to a place that gives you lots of perks like free lunch or back massages, understand that they are doing that because they are underpaying you.</p><p>If you are getting $130k salary, $70k in stock options, free lunch, and free laundry, that may sound like a pretty good deal, but what does that say about how much money the company is making off of you?</p><p>According to <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/top-tech-companies-revenue-per-employee-2015-10">Business Insider</a>:</p><p>This isn’t even skewed towards how much they make off of <strong><em>engineers</em></strong>.</p><p><strong>Software economics are unintuitive.<br>\n</strong></p><p>What is crazy about software is that it takes $0 to make new copies of a commodity that only has to be written once. This contrasts with the assembly line where each new unit takes new effort and human friction to reproduce. With software, only the first unit takes significant labor to produce.</p><p><strong>As software engineers, we have to rethink our value as workers in a marketplace with the insane leverage of software economics.</strong></p><p>Giant tech companies can pull off this arbitrage of underpaying engineers because engineers let themselves be seduced into a set of myths.</p><p>There is a narrative of a programmer who is incapable of doing anything except programming. Some programmers talk about this with pride, saying things like “I am just an engineer, I don’t want to think about the business side of things, I don’t understand the business side of things”.</p><p>Engineers have been seduced by the industrialist’s perspective that we cannot lead ourselves, we cannot evaluate opportunity cost, and we don’t understand the market as a whole.</p><p>All of these are lies, and the world will be more efficient and utilitarian if engineers take control of their careers and start evaluating the options outside of their immediate, narrow context.</p><p>If you started in sales, you can learn to become an engineer.<br>\nIf you started as an engineer and don’t like it, you can become a podcaster.</p><p>You don’t need a degree–if you can do the work, you can get a job as an engineer.</p><p><a href="http://softwaredaily.wpengine.com/2015/12/24/digital-nomadism-with-michael-rosenthal/">In the interview with my brother Michael Rosenthal</a>, he talked about dropping out of school and doing freelance programming, and how he has learned faster since getting out of the highly tracked education process.</p><p>In <a href="http://softwaredaily.wpengine.com/2015/11/18/software-and-entrepreneurship-with-seth-godin/">Seth Godin’s episode</a>, he talked about the deprecated education system, and the declining worth of a degree.</p><p><strong>Don’t let yourself be defined by your past, and the labels and messaging that society applies to you. You can take control of your life and define your future.</strong></p><p>You should be skipping to work. We spend most of our time at work.</p><p>The job market is <em>really </em>good right now because our economy is being completely reshaped by software. Massive economic opportunity is being generated:</p><p>These are economic fundamentals, not spurious technical signals.</p><p>Don’t believe the ranting and raving venture capitalists arguing for lower valuations and screaming about a bubble. Don’t believe the luddite anti-technologists who sneer into their lattes.</p><p>By any logical projection, the high demand for engineers isn’t dissipating any time soon…unless the entire economy collapses in some ghastly black swan catastrophe–in which case your current job will likely vaporize anyway.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=4&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwij7LLSiPTKAhUJzGMKHTCsD5cQFggvMAM&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F%40dhh%2Fthe-day-i-became-a-millionaire-55d7dc4d8293%3Fsource%3Dtop_stories---------5&amp;usg=AFQjCNEeQTB4N-gmHxhFkih4IhYIv2veFA&amp;sig2=PDjipjZZlHCXFBobHk0pYQ">David Heinemeier Hansson</a> said, it is worth considering how often your job puts you in a state of flow and tranquility.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Infrastructure software is having a renaissance.</p><p>Cloud providers offer a wide range of deployment tools, including virtual machines, managed Kubernetes clusters, standalone container instances, and serverless functions. Kubernetes has standardized the container orchestration layer and created a thriving community. The Kubernetes community gives the cloud providers a neutral ground to collaborate on projects that benefit everyone.</p><p>The two forces of cloud providers and Kubernetes have led to massive improvements in software quality and development practices over the last few years. But one downside of the current ecosystem is that many more developers learn how to operate a Kubernetes cluster than perhaps is necessary. “Serverless” tools are at a higher level than Kubernetes, and can improve developer productivity–but a risk of using a serverless tool is the potential for lock-in, and a lack of portability.</p><p>Knative is an open-source serverless platform from Google built on top of Kubernetes. Ville Aikas is a senior staff engineer at Google who has worked at the company for eleven years. With his experience, Ville brings a rare perspective to the subjects of Kubernetes, serverless, and the infrastructure lessons of Google. Ville joins the show to discuss Knative, the motivation for building it, and the future of “serverless” infrastructure.</p>',

Similar to how Ruby on Rails made web development approachable, scikit-learn takes away much of the frustrating aspects of machine learning, and lets the developer focus on building functionality with high-level APIs.</p><p>Per Harald Borgen is a developer at Xeneta. He started programming fairly recently, but has already built a machine learning application that cuts down on the time his sales team has to spend qualifying leads. What I found most interesting about this episode was that machine learning gets used by a single developer to solve a simple business problem and deliver solid value. This is in contrast to how many of us think about machine learning–as an intimidating domain that requires a large team to build anything meaningful.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>In the 1960s, advertising agencies were high-dollar creative producers. A client would come to an ad agency and pay millions of dollars for artistic messaging that would convince a consumer to buy a product. </p><p>How could you measure the success of these advertising campaigns? Maybe you could see success in the sales data. Maybe people were starting to talk about the product. Ultimately, success was defined by how satisfied the client was.</p><p>When it comes to measuring outcomes, advertising has always been a messy business.</p><p>Bob Hoffman’s long career in advertising included CEO positions at three different agencies. He helped huge brands craft their messaging, and grab consumer attention. In Bob’s world of advertising, lots of money was spent on creativity. Were the campaigns successful? That depends who you ask. In the old world of advertising, everyone acknowledged that success was subjective.</p><p>As human attention moved online, the world of advertising changed. Advertising began to move from TV and magazines to websites. Technology companies were formed to enable this new type of advertising–known as adtech. These companies claimed to bring scientific accuracy to advertising campaigns. The biggest adtech player was Google, who perfected search advertising.</p><p>If you could imagine the opposite of what Bob Hoffman built his career doing, it might look like search advertising. </p><p>Bob’s campaigns were about creating a brand’s voice, with colorful art and subtlety and ambient messaging. Advertising was about turning a brand into an entity you recognize, teaching the consumer to associate Nike with fitness, or Dove soap with clean hands, or Cheetos with cheesy, salty attitude.</p><p>Search advertising, on the other hand, is just text. You enter a search query, you are looking for black socks, and the top link that comes back is a line of text that says “cheap black socks.” Search advertising catches people who have an intent to do something. They have stated their intent by typing into a box. With search advertising, a brand might not even need a sexy, flashy creative.</p><p>The idea of intent-based advertising was expanded with retargeting. As you navigate through the internet, adtech companies are watching you, gathering data on your intent. Maybe you aren’t typing your desires explicitly into a search box–but you are clicking on articles and blog posts and tweets. With all your online interactions, adtech companies can figure out that you are looking for black socks whether you say so or not.</p><p>Money poured into adtech for very good reasons: intent-based marketing works. The shift to adtech put agencies in an uncomfortable position. If they couldn’t capture the advertising market by selling highly produced, unmeasurable creativity, they would have to make their money doing something else.</p><p>The situation was this: big brands like Procter and Gamble were buying most of their advertising through agencies. Procter and Gamble decided it wanted digital advertising. The adtech companies were the ones who knew how to produce and distribute digital advertising. Since agencies had the relationships with the big brands, and adtech companies had the technology, agencies began to partner with adtech companies.</p><p>This is actually a simplified version of what happens. Agencies subcontract advertising deals to digital agencies. A digital agency buys technology from a slew of adtech companies: some technology tracks users around the internet, some technology places bids on advertising spots that will land in front of users. Because of all the middlemen, the incentives are aligned against the brands.</p><p>Contrast this world of agencies and adtech companies with the world of Google and Facebook. They are a duopoly because they earned that position. By creating a single monolithic purchasing process, they have removed much of the risk that comes from a purchasing process stocked with middlemen.</p><p>But back to Bob Hoffman.</p><p>As money poured into adtech, user tracking, and Google, brands started to care more about metrics. When Bob met with a brand, the brand wouldn’t be asking about the cool new advertising campaign featuring a young actress drinking a Coca Cola. The brand would be asking about the click-through rate of a display advertising campaign. </p><p>Brands moved their focus to statistics, and away from creativity. And technology companies were happy to provide them with statistics. Whether those statistics were true or not is another story altogether. The industry was moving from creative BS to outright lying, and Bob decided to leave.</p><p>In today’s episode, Bob explains how the state of advertising became so problematic, and the ways in which it harms us Internet users.</p><p>We have done lots of reporting about advertising fraud for the last year, and it is a popular topic because people are often shocked to find that online advertising is inextricably linked to organized crime, surveillance, and Twitter botnets. That’s not to say that online advertising doesn’t work–it certainly does! But understanding the dark underbelly of the Internet’s cash cow is a necessary precondition to finding a solution. </p><p>To find all of our old episodes about ad fraud, you can download <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/software-engineering-daily-podcast-app/id1253734426?mt=8">the Software Engineering Daily app for iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.koalatea.thehollidayinn.softwareengineeringdaily">for Android</a>.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Firebase is a backend-as-a-service. The key efficiency of a backend-as-a-service is that it enables developers to go from having a 3-tier architecture (client, server, database) to a 2-tier architecture (client, backend-as-a-service).</p><p>The team who started Firebase built it as a pivot. They had started a social network, and then they realized there wasn’t a good backend for chat tools. And so they started a chat-as-a-service tool, for people who wanted to include chat in their applications. And that led them to the fundamental realization that chat is actually representative of a broader category of real-time synchronization problems. Firebase was eventually acquired by Google.</p><p>Doug Stevenson is a senior developer advocate with Google and the host of Meet Firebase, a YouTube talk show about Firebase. It was a pleasure to sit down for a conversation with him, especially because I recently started using Firebase in my own application as a backend for real-time chat.</p><p>Transcript provided by We Edit Podcasts.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Social media has transformed our lives. It has also transformed how wars are fought. P.W. Singer’s new book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LikeWar-Weaponization-P-W-Singer/dp/1328695743/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1548625820&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=likewar">“Likewar: The Weaponization of Social Media”</a> describes the far-reaching impact of social media on the tactics and strategies used by military, business, and everyday citizens.</p><p>We have all read about stories such as Russian bots and Cambridge Analytica, but Likewar covers many more cases that are surprising and mildly frightening. From the Gaza Strip to the streets of Chicago to Taylor Swift’s Instagram feed, Likewar describes just how pervasive the effect of social media has been on warfare.</p><p>Likewar also provides historical context. For software engineers, the repurposing of social media as a weapon is disconcerting. Many of us are working on products with a social networking component. Does this make us complicit in building weapons?</p><p>We can find some reassurance in the fact that this has happened before: from the newspaper to the television, every new invention has been used repurposed for war.</p><p>In a war, a new piece of technology always presents a new vector to gain an advantage in a conflict. Because the stakes are so high in a war, there is a large incentive to find creative ways to use technology to undermine your adversaries and to help your allies.</p><p><a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2017/12/22/modern-war-with-peter-warren-singer/">P.W. Singer has written about robotics, cybersecurity, and modern warfare for a decade.

How Status connects to the Ethereum blockchain, what people want from Ethereum applications, and the engineering of the Status app itself. Status is built using React Native–which is working out quite well for them.</p><p>We also talked some about the mechanics of an ICO. Status has raised $100m in their ICO for the Status Network Token. An ICO differs from raising equity in several ways. Rather than representing a direct stake in the business, a token represents a stake in the ecosystem that is being built. </p><p>Through their ICO, Status raised much more than a startup at a similar stage in company development would have–and the vesting schedule for the founders is 2 years. After two years, their stake will be liquid. This illustrates another way that the ICO can contrast with a traditional startup equity offering. </p><p>In a traditional startup, there is not a liquid open market for equity prior to the company going public. This can be good, as it forces the founders to maintain their skin in the game until they have proven the business. But it can also be bad–founders should arguably be able to take some money off of the table even if their business model is not completely worked out.</p><p>In the interview, Jarrad explained that he anticipates the open source community around Status to be contributing more to the Status app over time, because the community has a stake in the app by purchasing the Status token. I hope this is the case–it would be very cool to see more consumer-facing open source applications. </p><p>Status is a consumer facing app–and it did make me think that it is strange that there is so much open source software for building applications (think about React Native, Kubernetes, Kafka), but there are fewer consumer-facing open source apps. There’s not an open source Uber, an open source Facebook, or an open source Google. Why is that?</p><p>Maybe that’s because we are still in the days where someone has to pay for the backend compute layer. In other words–open source code is free to host, but running the actual application infrastructure still requires the owner to pay–so it makes sense that consumer applications are still developed and maintained by central actors. </p><p>With Ethereum, maybe that will change and we will see more consumer facing, open source, decentralized applications. That is certainly the world that Status.im is hoping for.</p><p>Speaking of consumer facing open source applications: check out our Software Engineering Daily apps on the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/software-engineering-daily/id1253734426?mt=8">iOS</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.koalatea.thehollidayinn.softwareengineeringdaily&amp;hl=en">Android</a> app store.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>In America, the tech companies we focus on are commonly known as FAANG: Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google. We all know what these companies do because they impact our daily lives. In Asia, there are three giant tech companies that have similar scale: Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent, otherwise known as BAT.</p><p>Technology within a location is shaped by the pressures of that location. You might think we live in a global society, but tech in Asia is dramatically different than it is in America. Differences in culture lead to differences in product development.</p><p>In China, a different political system contributed to more rapid adoption of online payments. Because there is more payment data, people can be given loans more efficiently. Less of the population is “unbanked.” Online payments are mostly handled by WeChat, a social networking product from Tencent, and Alibaba, an ecommerce giant. If you live in the West, imagine that Facebook and Amazon handled most of your payments for everything. You would have a different relationship with those companies.</p><p>Bernard Leong is the host of Analyse Asia, a podcast about Asian developments in technology in business. After studying materials science in Singapore and theoretical physics at Cambridge, he made his way into business and journalism, and developed an interest in the Singularity–a subject that few people took seriously until recently (one topic we explored in this show is Masayoshi Son, the Japanese tycoon who wants to invest nearly a trillion dollars into technology companies; Masayoshi believes firmly that the Singularity is coming).</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/SGJ5cZnoodY">Shenzhen: The Silicon Valley of Hardware (Full Documentary) | Future Cities | WIRED</a></p><p><em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Plex-Google-Thinks-Works-Shapes/dp/1416596585">In the Plex</a></em> by Steven Levy</p><p><a href="http://blog.ycombinator.com/the-hidden-forces-behind-toutiao-chinas-content-king/">The Hidden Forces Behind Toutiao: China’s Content King</a></p><p>Transcript provided by We Edit Podcasts.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Cloud Foundry is an open-source platform as a service for deploying and managing web applications. Cloud Foundry is widely used by enterprises who are running applications that are built using Spring, a popular web framework for Java applications, but developers also use Cloud Foundry to manage apps built in Ruby, Node and any other programming language. Cloud Foundry includes routing, message brokering, service discovery, authentication and other application level tooling for building and managing a distributed system. Some of the standard tooling in Cloud Foundry was adopted from Netflix open-source projects, such as Hystrix, which is the circuit breaker system; and Eureka, which is the service discovery server and client.</p><p>When a developer deploys their application to Cloud Foundry, the details of what is going on are mostly abstracted away, which is by design. When you’re trying to ship code and iterate quickly for your organization, you don’t want to think about how your application image is being deployed to underlying infrastructure. You don’t want to think about whether you’re deploying a container or a VM, but if you use Cloud Foundry enough, you might have become curious about how Cloud Foundry schedules and runs application code.</p><p>BOSH is a component of Cloud Foundry that sits between the infrastructure layer and the application layer. Cloud Foundry can be deployed to any cloud provider because of BOSH’s well-defined interface. BOSH has the abstraction of a stem cell, which is a versioned operating system image wrapped in packaging for whatever infrastructure as a service is running underneath. With BOSH, whenever a VM gets deployed no your underlying infrastructure, that VM gets a BOSH agent. The agent communicates with the centralized component of BOSH called the director. This role of director is the leader of the distributed system.</p><p>Rupa Nandi is a director of engineering at Pivotal where she works on Cloud Foundry. In this episode we talked about scheduling an infrastructure, the relationship between Spring and Cloud Foundry and the impact of Kubernetes, which Cloud Foundry has integrated with so that users can run Kubernetes workloads on Cloud Foundry.</p><p>I interviewed Rupa at SpringOne Platform, a conference that is organized by Pivotal who, full disclosure, is a sponsor of Software Engineering Daily, and this week’s episode are all conversations from that conference. Whether you like this format or don’t like this format, I would love to get your feedback. We have some big developments coming for Software Engineering Daily in 2018 and we want to have a closer dialogue with the listeners.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Cryptocurrencies are not very usable today. The main use cases for cryptocurrencies today are store of value (somewhat like gold) and speculation. One reason that the use cases are so narrow is the problem of scalability. Cryptocurrencies have several scalability bottlenecks.</p><p>Think about the Internet in 1994. The consumer sitting at home with a dial-up modem was bottlenecked on bandwidth between their home and the broader network. The physical network connections between our homes and Internet company servers were much lower bandwidth than we have today. The servers at companies such as AOL were slow and expensive.</p><p>The Internet scalability problems were incrementally solved, one by one. Different solutions to different scalability problems emerged in an iterative, frothy process. Then, all of a sudden, you are sitting on an airplane watching YouTube videos on a smartphone.</p><p>Watching YouTube videos on a smartphone would have sounded unbelievable to someone in 1994, much like sending someone a penny across the Internet is unbelievable today. If you want to send a penny across the world today, you will probably have to pay several dollars worth of transaction costs.</p><p>Someday, you will be able to use cryptocurrency to send 1 penny to someone in another continent halfway around the world. The transaction fee you pay will be a fraction of a penny. This removal of financial friction due to transaction costs will change global economics.</p><p>What stands between modern cryptocurrencies and that beautiful future world of micropayments? A large set of scalability problems, similar to the scalability problems of the consumer Internet in 1994. In today’s show, we focus on one particular issue of scalability: block propagation time.</p><p>Cryptocurrency transactions are verified by miners. On the Bitcoin blockchain, a set of transactions gets verified roughly every 10 minutes. These transactions represent a “block” on the blockchain. The miner who solves the cryptographic puzzle associated with the transactions in that block receives payment in the form of a block reward and the transaction fees that are associated with those transactions.</p><p>When you issue a transaction to the Bitcoin network, your transaction sits in the mempool, a list of pending transactions that have not been confirmed by the mining process yet. Miners around the world are simultaneously competing with each other to find a solution to a pending set of transactions sitting in this mempool. When a miner includes your transaction in a block, and the miner discovers a solution to that block, your transaction will probably be accepted into the blockchain.</p><p>The reason that your transaction is not guaranteed to be accepted is due to a time period known as “block propagation time”. Block propagation time is the time it takes for a confirmed block of transactions to make its way through a blockchain network. If two blocks are solved at nearly the same time by different miners, the winner of the current block reward will be the miner whose block manages to propagate through the network the fastest.</p><p>BloxRoute Labs is a company that is developing a blockchain distribution network (BDN). Much like a CDN pushes media files out to the edges of the web to make them faster to access, a BDN pushes out information to miners in the network. Of course, this means that the BDN could potentially be centralized infrastructure. In order to make the BDN effectively decentralized and trustworthy, BloxRoute claims to have a provably trustable network protocol, to go with its token-based incentive system that keeps its goals aligned with that of the larger blockchain world.</p><p>Aleksander Kuzmanovic is the founder of BloxRoute Labs, as well as a professor of computer science at Northwestern University. His co-founders of BloxRoute include former guests of the show Emin Gun Sirer and Soumya Basu. The BloxRoute founders have a strong theoretical background and a great reputation in the cryptocurrency community, unlike the vast majority of founders who have issued a token.</p><p>As we have heard in previous episodes, most of the founders of companies that issue tokens cannot give a good explanation for why their protocol needs a token. Tokens are a great idea that have mostly been applied as a mechanism to get rich quickly. However, BloxRoute has a credible explanation for their token, and I asked some very pointed questions to Aleksander in today’s episode to try to vet the project for legitimacy, and his reasoning made sense.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>If you operate a restaurant, you want to know how many people are inside your restaurant at any given time. You also want to be able to know your occupancy if you operate a movie theater, coffee shop, or apparel store. </p><p>Knowing how many people are in your building can answer several business-related questions. Do you need to unlock an additional entrance? Should you open another store? Do you really need a building this big?</p><p>This might sound like a simple question, but how do you solve the problem of counting people inside of a building? </p><p>A naive approach to counting people is to use video cameras and count the number of people entering and exiting the building. Machine learning algorithms are good at classifying humans. But the downside of this is that you have to put cameras anywhere you want a people-counter. There are many situations where you would want to count the number of people where a camera is not acceptable. What if you wanted to count people in a privacy preserving way? What if you wanted to obscure any identifiable traits of a person that you were counting?</p><p>Density is a device for counting people. It sits above a doorway and counts the people who are entering or exiting the building. Andrew Farah is the CEO at Density, and in today’s episode he explains why the problem of counting people is harder than it sounds, and how the Density people counter functions.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>In the early days of YouTube, there were scalability problems with the MySQL database that hosted the data model for all of YouTube’s videos. The state of the art solution to scaling MySQL at the time was known as “application-level sharding.”</p><p>To scale a database using application-level sharding, you break up the database into shards–disjoint regions of data. When you want to query the database, you need know which shard to query. In your application code, you have to issue the query to a specific shard. </p><p>The solution of application-level sharding does scale your database. But the downside is that every application that interfaces with the database now has to include code that is aware of the sharding schema. </p><p>If you are an application engineer, you don’t want to have to worry about the way that the database is sharded, because it adds significant complexity to your code. The engineers at YouTube decided to fix this problem with a project called Vitess. Vitess abstracts away the details of sharding by orchestrating reads and writes across the distributed database.</p><p>In a previous episode, we covered the architecture, read and write path, and the story of Vitess in detail. In today’s episode, Jiten Vaidya and Dan Kozlowski of PlanetScale Data join the show to give their perspective on MySQL scalability, and their work taking Vitess to market as a solution to scaling relational databases. </p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Facebook’s strategy is shaped by long term goals, short term requirements, and the available resources of the company.</p><p>Long term goals are necessary for thinking through big decisions such as acquisitions, hardware product investments, and open source software ecosystems. To implement long term goals, Facebook needs to communicate the vision of the company and foster an internal culture that supports that vision.</p><p>Short term requirements can affect how the company is thinking on a more immediate time horizon.</p><p>When Facebook realized the importance of mobile computing, the mentality in the company quickly shifted from looking at mobile as a tax on engineering resources to a long-term source of business value. When Google started to work on Google+, Facebook engineers focused their resources on the potential competitive threat.</p><p>Facebook’s strategy is implemented by the engineers, product managers, and other employees of the company. Facebook is unique in its ability to allow those employees to self-assemble into work that is meaningful to the individuals as well as to the company. </p><p>As the long term goals and short term requirements of Facebook change over time, company resources are shifted to focus the company on the correct set of priorities.

When you press enter, some of your search results may be widgets that represent the weather, the price of a stock, a recipe for green bean soup, or a language translation for a phrase. These complex frontend components are loading dynamically–the Google Search application cannot prefetch every single possible widget that you might ask for–but the results do load very quickly.</p><p>Google has many other examples of advanced JavaScript engineering. The company is mostly known for backend engineering inventions like MapReduce, TensorFlow, Dremel, and Spanner. To turn these backend tools into user facing products, Google develops its own JavaScript frameworks and infrastructure to deliver information from the backend to the frontend.</p><p>“Backend” and “frontend” are not precise terms. At Google, there are so many layers of infrastructure between a user and the data center. If you are an engineer working on a service at Google, you probably have several “frontends” and “backends” on either side of you.</p><p>Malte Ubl is a senior staff engineer at Google. He’s heavily involved in Google’s JavaScript infrastructure, and has written about <a href="https://medium.com/@cramforce/designing-very-large-javascript-applications-6e013a3291a3">managing large JavaScript applications</a> in detail. He also works on AMP, an open-source project for delivering web pages in a fast, performant format. He joins the show to describe Google’s history with JavaScript frameworks, the process of building frontends and middleware to deliver JavaScript applications, and the engineering behind AMP. There are criticisms of AMP, but some of them misunderstand how the AMP technology actually works.  AMP allows pages to be cached, prefetched, and served to a user more quickly. AMP does not necessarily centralize pages around being served from Google Search. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/53q42z/read_reddit_faster_via_google_with_amp/">A good example of AMP speeding up pages outside of Google is reddit</a>.</p><p>We recently launched a new podcast: Fintech Daily!

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>The Windows operating system is one of the most widely used pieces of software in history. Windows was started before there was any alternative to a monolithic codebase, because Microsoft was building software before the Internet was widely used by consumers. Networked computers gave rise to web applications, and software engineers began to rethink how to build everything.</p><p>Software development got reimagined with agile. Monolithic codebases got broken up into service-oriented architecture. Instead of going to a store to buy a box with software in it, users downloaded software from the Internet, and that software was regularly updated.</p><p>Software that is regularly updated needs to be regularly tested. Instead of a single round of testing for every round of boxed software that was shipped to a store, continuous testing and delivery gradually became the norm. The process of releasing and operating software became its own set of engineering challenges–which was tackled by the “operations” or “sys admin” team at a software company.</p><p>Now there were two different sets of engineers–those who were developing the software and those who were operating the software. The incentives of these two types of engineers were not completely aligned. The software developers wanted to build software quickly and release new features. The operators wanted things to release software slowly, because if something broke then the operators were the first line of defense for fixing it.</p><p>These problems between development and operations gave rise to the “DevOps” movement, in which developers and operations started working more closely together and sharing responsibilities. Incentives became aligned, and new types of software was created to facilitate more harmonious relationships between developers and operations–for example, <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/09/18/continuous-delivery-pipelines-with-abel-wang/">continuous delivery pipelines</a>.</p><p>Today, most enterprises are still undergoing a transformation from monolithic software release cycles to continuous delivery. This is often referred to as a “DevOps Transformation”. A DevOps Transformation requires the entire organization to reorient itself around faster software release cycles. This can be a painful process, and <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/?s=devops">we have covered it in many past shows</a>. Hearing case studies from enterprises can be helpful for figuring out how to reorient your own enterprise.</p><p>Microsoft is a useful case study in shifting towards DevOps. Windows is perhaps the biggest monolithic codebase in history. The fact that Microsoft could rearchitect Windows to be easier to work with should provide some reassurance to other enterprises who are currently undergoing their own migrations.</p><p>Martin Woodward has been at Microsoft for 13 years and he joins the show to talk about how software delivery within the company has evolved. We discussed the move from boxed software delivery to delivery via the cloud, and focused on a few specific, longstanding products such as Windows. Martin has been part of the effort to build Azure DevOps, which is a product that offers similar tools to the ones Microsoft built internally for DevOps as a service. We also talk about the specific difficulties that enterprises often have when moving toward DevOps. Full disclosure: Microsoft is a sponsor of Software Engineering Daily.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Your friends from college are asking you how to buy Bitcoin. Your mom is emailing you articles about the benefits of decentralized peer-to-peer networks. Your shoe shiner is telling you to buy XRP.</p><p>It is 2018, and cryptocurrencies have become a daily part of news headlines. The general public may not understand how this technology works, but everyone knows that changes are on the horizon. At some point in the future, our financial and computing systems will be deeply integrated with the cryptoeconomy.</p><p>We all remember the dot com boom. We know that some people got fantastically rich during that period through speculation. We think–maybe this is our chance to make money.</p><p>If you read reddit, or almost any news site, you will see stories of obscene wealth intertwine with pseudoscientific discussions of how a new cryptocurrency is going to change the world. What is fact and what is fiction? How far are we from a beautiful future, with frictionless micropayments?</p><p>Matt Leising is a journalist at Bloomberg who has covered financial markets for 15 years. Today, his reporting has been completely engulfed by cryptocurrencies. There are so many dramatic stories, it’s hard to pick what to focus on.</p><p>Today, we discuss two topics he has covered recently: Ripple and Tether.</p><p>Ripple is a company that makes enterprise blockchain solutions for global payments. That sounds like the future, and it is no surprise that people would want to buy into Ripple if possible. Ripple has been around for 7 years, and they have a strong team, and relationships with major financial institutions.</p><p>One of Ripple’s early projects was a currency called XRP.  The goal of XRP was to make a fast, scalable digital asset that would facilitate currency exchange among banks. We covered Ripple and XRP in previous episodes with <a href="https://www.softwaredaily.com/#/post/5913c0e84ee01db33cacd06b/Cryptofinancial-Security-with-David-Schwartz-of-Ripple-Labs">David Schwartz</a> and <a href="https://www.softwaredaily.com/#/post/5913c0f04ee01db33cacd080/Ripple-with-Greg-Kidd">Greg Kidd</a>.</p><p>XRP remains in circulation, but Ripple the company has shifted development resources away from XRP, and towards RippleNet, which seeks to replace the aging SWIFT code system for banks. Today, XRP is being experimented with by several money transfer companies, but the digital currency is not widely used for anything–well, other than speculation.</p><p>In the tremendous cryptocoin bull run of early 2018, XRP shot up as sharply as almost any other coin. In an article about Ripple, Matt Leising tried to get to the root explanation for why this occurred. Was it a sudden market recognition of some long term value of XRP? Was it a stampeding herd of people who did not know the state of XRP? Was it a pump and dump?</p><p>A few days after publishing his article about Ripple, Matt wrote about Tether. Tether purports to be a “stablecoin”–a digital currency which is pegged to the value of something less volatile. Stablecoins are useful in that they can reduce friction of exchange between tokens. Without a stablecoin, you might have to transfer from one cryptocurrency to USD, which probably involves the US banking system. </p><p>There’s a good discussion of stablecoins in <a href="https://www.softwaredaily.com/#/post/59f6f12e6bec0d7991ac2510/Cryptoeconomics-with-Vlad-Zamfir">our episode with Vlad Zamfir and Haseeb Qureshi on cryptoeconomics.</a></p><p>If you can use Tether instead of USD, you have less transactional friction. Perhaps you can escape the onerous tax consequences of day trading cryptocurrencies. Tether claims to have $1 USD in reserve for every 1 Tether in circulation. </p><p>So if you wanted to cash out Tether for USD, you should theoretically be able to do that–except that Tether seems to have no connection to any banks. And Tether has severed its ties with auditing agencies that it was working with.</p><p>There is $2.3B of Tether in circulation. That is a small fraction of the overall trading volume of cryptocurrencies. But it is unknown how much the current crypto bubble is propped up by the functionality of Tether–the ability to seamlessly move between cryptocurrencies without going into USD. As long as the market believes in Tether (and today it is indeed at $.999014) in valuation, this stablecoin mystique will persist, and market friction will continue to be smoothed out by that belief.</p><p>This was Matt’s second appearance on the show, and it was a blast to have him back on. In his last episode, he discussed the infamous DAO hack, which led to an Ethereum fork.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Each cloud provider offers a different set of services which are not always compatible with each other. What are the challenges of building an application that interoperates with multiple different clouds?</p><p>The first issue is API compatibility.</p><p>Most cloud providers have a managed SQL offering, a bucket storage system, and server abstractions like virtual machines and containers. But these tools might have different APIs on each cloud. The code that you wrote to save your application data to Amazon S3 might have to be rewritten if you decide to switch your bucket storage to a different provider.</p><p>Another issue that interferes with cloud interoperability is the degree of integration on a particular cloud. If I build my application for AWS, I might be heavily integrated with Amazon’s Identity and Access Management policy system and AWS logging. Each cloud provider makes it particularly easy to connect to their integrated solutions.</p><p>There is also the problem of services on one cloud that simply do not map to a service on any other cloud. Google Cloud Bigtable does not have an equivalent service on Amazon. Microsoft CosmosDB does not have an equivalent service on Digital Ocean.</p><p>As developers, this irritates us. We want to be able to deploy our application to any cloud. We want to be able to move applications easily from one cloud to another. And we want to mix tools from different clouds together as easily as we import a library.</p><p>Bassam Tabbara is the CEO of Upbound, a company focused on making multicloud applications easier to deploy and operate.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Facebook serves interactive content to billions of users. Google serves query requests on the world’s biggest search engine. Uber handles a significant percentage of the transportation within the United States. These services are handling radically different types of traffic, but many of the techniques they use to balance loads are similar. </p><p>Vivek Panyam is an engineer with Uber, and he previously interned at Google and Facebook. In a popular <a href="https://blog.vivekpanyam.com/scaling-a-web-service-load-balancing/">blog post about load balancing at scale</a>, he described how a large company scales up a popular service. The methods for scaling up load balancing are simple, but effective–and they help to illustrate how load balancing works at different layers of the networking stack.</p><p>Let’s say you have a simple service where a user makes a request, and your service sends them a response with a cat picture. Your service starts to get popular, and begins timing out and failing to send a response to users.</p><p>When your service starts to get overwhelmed, you can scale up load by creating another service instance that is a copy of your cat picture service. Now you have two service instances, and you can use a layer 7 load balancer to route traffic evenly between those two service instances. You can keep adding service instances as the load scales and have the load distributed among those new instances. </p><p>Eventually, your L7 load balancer is handling so much traffic itself that you can’t put any more service instances in front of it. So you have to set up another L7 load balancer, and put an L4 load balancer in front of those L7 load balancers. You can scale up that tier of L7 load balancers, each of which is balancing traffic across a set of your service instances. But eventually, even your L4 load balancer gets overwhelmed with requests for cat pictures. You have to set up another tier, this time with L3 load balancing…</p><p>In this episode, Vivek gives a clear description for how load balancing works. We also review the 7 networking layers before discussing why there are different types of load balancers associated with the different networking layers.</p><p>Transcript provided by We Edit Podcasts.

Zcash implements the same core features of Bitcoin, with the added functionality of shielded payments.</p><p>Shielded payments are private, and they are enabled by a novel cryptographic technique called zk-SNARKS: zero knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge. A zk-SNARK allows for the proof that a certain piece of information is valid without revealing any information other than the validity of that information itself.</p><p>Before you listen to this episode, it might be useful to go back to our previous episode about <a href="https://www.softwaredaily.com/post/5913c07c4ee01db33cacceb0">Zcash with Nathan Wilcox</a>, in which he gives an overview of the technology.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p><em>Originally posted on 1 May 2018.</em></p><p>Technology is pushing us rapidly toward a future that is impossible to forecast. We try to imagine what that future might look like, and we can’t help having our predictions shaped by the media we have consumed.</p><p>1984, Terminator, Gattaca, Ex Machina, Black Mirror–all of these stories present a dystopian future. But if you look around the world, the most successful technologists are mostly guided by a sense of optimism. Technologists themselves are mostly idealistic–they see the future through a utopian lens. Popular media largely tells a different story: that we are headed for a dystopian world.</p><p>Why is there such a gulf in the level of idealism between technologists and the media? </p><p>Mike Solana found himself asking that question on a regular basis during his work at Founder’s Fund, where he is a vice president. Founder’s Fund has a bias toward funding difficult, cutting-edge technology like gene editing, robotics, and nuclear energy. This technology that Mike was seeing made him excited about the future–which led to his creation of the podcast “Anatomy of Next.”</p><p>“Anatomy of Next” has explored biology, robotics, nuclear energy, superintelligence, and the nature of reality. Soon the podcast will be exploring how our civilization will explore and settle the solar system–specifically Mars. </p><p>I’ve listened through the entire first season of the show twice and enjoyed it so much because Mike explores questions that are on the border of philosophy and technology–questions about the nature of reality, and what makes us human–and nobody can give perfect answers to these questions. But Mike interviews top experts on the show, which provides us with a framework. Guests on “Anatomy of Next” include Nick Bostrom (the author of Superintelligence), George Church (a pioneer in gene editing), and Palmer Luckey (the founder of VR company Oculus).</p><p>Mike joins the show to talk about why he started “Anatomy of Next,” and his own perspective on the future.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Every program gets compiled down to 1s and 0s before it can be executed against hardware. Before being translated to machine code, programs that are written in a language like Rust, Swift, or Java spend time in an intermediate representation. </p><p>In Java, this intermediate representation is Java bytecode. Many different languages–such as Scala–translate to Java bytecode, because there has been lots of optimization written to speed up Java bytecode. Java bytecode runs on the JVM–the Java Virtual Machine.</p><p>LLVM is a project that draws inspiration from the Java Virtual Machine. LLVM originally meant “low level virtual machine” but today it is just called LLVM and describes a set of compiler tools.</p><p>In today’s interview with Morgan Wilde, we explore how compilers work, how different processor hardware architectures present a problem for compilers, and why LLVM’s intermediate representation creates a layer of interoperability for any language that compiles down to that intermediate representation.</p><p>Whether you are new to compilers or have experience, this episode will appeal to you. Morgan is an excellent teacher and his enthusiasm for the subject comes through. He has a 30-minute YouTube video–<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5-WaD8VV38&amp;t=992s">A Brief Introduction to LLVM</a> that I highly recommend.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Spotify is a streaming music company with more than 50 million users. Whenever a user listens to a song, Spotify records that event and uses it as input to learn more about the user’s preferences. Listening to a song is one type of event–there are hundreds of others. Opening the Spotify app, skipping a song, sharing a playlist with a friend–all of these are events that provide valuable insights to Spotify.</p><p>These are not the only types of events that Spotify cares about. There are also events that occur at the infrastructure level–for example a logging server that runs out of disk space. There are events that are relevant to all the users on Spotify–for example a new album release from Taylor Swift.</p><p>An “event” is an object that needs to be registered within a system. Since there are so many events on a platform like Spotify, delivering and processing them reliably requires significant investment.</p><p>Modern Internet companies are built by connecting cloud services, databases, and internal tools together. These different systems might respond to different events in different ways. Each system subscribes to the types of events that it wants to hear. Since there are so many events, and they might be received at uneven bursts, a modern architecture has a scalable queueing system to buffer events.</p><p>To put an event on the queue, the event producer “publishes” that event to the queue. The event is then received by each “subscriber.” That’s why queueing is often known as pub/sub–publish/subscribe.</p><p>Igor Maravic is an engineer with Spotify. In this episode, he explains why pub/sub is a key element of Spotify’s infrastructure–and he describes the migration that Spotify has made from Apache Kafka to Google Cloud Pubsub.</p><p>If you like this episode, we have done many other shows about cloud infrastructure.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Software engineers have interacted with operations teams since software was being written. In the 1990s, most operations teams worked with physical infrastructure. They made sure that servers were provisioned correctly and installed with the proper software. When software engineers shipped bad code that took down a software company, the operations teams had to help recover the system—which often meant dealing with the physical servers.</p><p>During the 90s and early 2000s, these operations engineers were often called “sysadmins,” “database admins” (if they worked on databases), or “infrastructure engineers.” Over the last decade, virtualization has led to many more logical servers across a company. Cloud computing has made infrastructure remote and programmable. </p><p>The progression of infrastructure led to a change in how operations engineers work. Since infrastructure can be interacted with through code, operations engineers are now writing a lot more code. </p><p>The “DevOps” movement can be seen through this lens. Operations teams were now writing software—and this meant that software engineers could now work on operations. Both software engineers and operators could create deployment pipelines, monitor application health, and improve the system scalability—all through written code. </p><p>Site reliability engineering (or SRE) is a newer point along the evolutionary timeline of operations. Web applications can be unstable sometimes, and SRE is focused on making a site work more reliably. This is especially important for a company that makes business applications which other companies rely on.</p><p>Mike Hiraga is the head of site reliability engineering at Atlassian. Atlassian makes several products that many businesses rely on—such as JIRA, Confluence, HipChat, and Bitbucket. Since the infrastructure is at a massive scale, Mike has a broad set of experiences from his work managing SRE at Atlassian. </p><p>One particularly interesting topic is Atlassian’s migration to the cloud. Atlassian was started in 2002, before the cloud was widely used, and they have more recently made a push to move applications into the cloud. Full disclosure: Atlassian is a sponsor of Software Engineering Daily—and they are hiring, so if you are looking for a job, check out Atlassian jobs, or send me an email directly and I’m happy to introduce you to the team.</p><p>Transcript provided by We Edit Podcasts.

These services can be written in different languages, by different people, but communication between services needs to be standardized. For this reason, a service proxy is useful. A service proxy is a sidecar container that sits next to a service and facilitates communications with other services. </p><p>Once every service has a sidecar proxy, that sidecar can be used as a way to communicate with a centralized control plane. The sidecar can report telemetry data to the control plane, and the control plane can be used to set policies across services, such as rules for scaling and load balancing which might vary from service to service. </p><p>Istio is an open platform to connect, manage, and secure microservices.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Flutter allows developers to build cross-platform mobile apps. In our previous show about Flutter, Eric Seidel from Google described the goals of Flutter, why he founded the project, and how Flutter is built. In today’s show, Randal Schwartz talks about Flutter in more detail–including the developer experience of building Flutter apps and why he finds Flutter so exciting.</p><p>Randal is a longtime software developer who has focused mostly on web applications. He’s also the host of the popular podcast FLOSS Weekly, a show about open source software. Like many developers, Randal has stayed away from mobile development in the past. If you write a mobile application, you have historically had to build iOS and Android apps separately. That is a large up-front cost, and Flutter reduces the cost by allowing users to develop mobile apps for iOS and Android with a single codebase.</p><p>Randal has been podcasting about open source software for 12 years, so he brings historical depth to this conversation. He has also been working with Dart for several years–Dart is a language developed by Google that is used in Flutter.</p>',

Examples of bots include automated reply systems, intelligent chat bots, classification systems, and prediction machines. These systems are often powered by machine learning systems that are black boxes to the user. </p><p>Today’s guest Rob May argues that these systems should be auditable and accountable, and that using a blockchain-based identity system for bots is a viable solution to the machine learning auditability problem.</p><p>Rob is the CEO of Talla, a knowledge base provider for business teams. The Botchain project was spun out of Talla as a solution to the problem of bot identity.</p><p>In this episode, we talk about Botchain and the application of blockchain to bot identity, the current state of ICOs, and the viability of utility token ecosystems. Botchain has its own cryptotoken called “Botcoin.”</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Over 12 years of engineering, Box has developed a complex architecture of services. Whenever a user uploads a file to Box, that upload might cause 5 or 6 different services to react to the event. Each of these services is managed by a set of servers, and managing all of these different servers is a challenge.</p><p>Sam Ghods is the cofounder and services architect of Box. In 2014, Sam was surveying the landscape of different resource managers, deciding which tool should be the underlying scheduler for deploying services at Box. He chose Kubernetes because it was based on Google’s internal Borg scheduling system. </p><p>For years, engineering teams at companies like Facebook and Twitter had built internal scheduling systems modeled after Borg. When Kubernetes arrived, it provided an out-of-the-box tool for managing infrastructure like Google would.</p><p>In today’s episode, Sam describes how Box began its migration to Kubernetes, and what the company has learned along the way. It’s a great case study for people who are looking at migrating their own systems to Kubernetes.</p><p>Transcript provided by We Edit Podcasts.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Docker containers changed how engineers think about building software, and the company most responsible for the widespread adoption of containers is Docker itself. Since containerization has caught on in the mainstream, companies like RedHat, Google, Huawei, and many other big players have built platform products that utilize Docker containers.</p><p>Docker containers are the unit that many engineers use to deploy their applications, but the servers that run those containers are usually on infrastructure providers like Amazon, Google, or Rackspace. This raises the question–how will Docker the company make money? Having raised $180M in equity, Docker has plenty of time to find something that works, but there are suspicions in the open source community that aggressive changes to the open source Docker project are being made by Docker the company with the long-term objective of monetization. </p><p>These changes–namely the default support for Docker Swarm–are not nefarious, but they might be less likely to occur of Docker were just an open source project, as opposed to an open source project being tended by a well-financed company. </p><p>The New Stack broke the story about the potential Docker Fork, and Alex Williams and Joab Jackson of The New Stack join me on today’s episode. We go deep into the facts and speculations about why a fork might occur, the motivations of different key players, and the disputes within the community that have led us to this moment.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Bots on the internet can be malicious, helpful, and everything in between. A bot that responds to all of your tweets might call you a socialist–that is malicious. Google crawls the web to index Google search. That is helpful. Social media marketing bots schedule 200 Twitter posts to go out throughout the day. That is either a little annoying or a little helpful depending on who you are.  </p><p>Bots are being used to amplify political viewpoints. An amplified viewpoint can serve as a gravity well for like-minded individuals, and help a sparsely supported political cause find its footing. Sometimes that amplified viewpoint is completely fictional or unfalsifiable. Real people believe that Hillary Clinton is a lizard alien because they have seen that story shared by enough Twitter bots.</p><p>So-called “fake news” is a topic that has been discussed on so many other podcasts. What is not reported is the connection between link bait and advertising fraud. When a botnet is able to make an article go viral, thousands of people organically click on the link to that article. That organic traffic is used to launder fake clicks.</p><p>These bots that are spreading “fake news” might be controlled by conspiratorial Russians. But it doesn’t have to be that complicated. Anyone who wants to make money in online advertising fraud is incentivized to make salacious media–whether it is real or fake.</p><p>Samuel Woolley is the director of research at Political Bots. He works with Jigsaw, a division of Alphabet that seeks to make the Internet safer. In today’s episode, we talk about political bots, advertising fraud, and the connection between the two.</p><p>Software Engineering Daily is having our third Meetup, Wednesday May 3rd at Galvanize in San Francisco.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Software engineering is harder than it should be. There are many people who have an app idea that they are not sure how to build. Some of these people are highly technical professionals like real estate agents, scientists, and accountants.</p><p>These professionals learn to use spreadsheets in their day-to-day work. Spreadsheets are also used widely by young people such as students. Spreadsheet users vary in terms of how familiar they are with the programmability of a spreadsheet, but there are certainly more people who have built complex spreadsheets than there are people who have built complex web apps.</p><p>Airtable is a tool for making application development easier and more accessible. The Airtable interface is similar to a spreadsheet and can be used for most spreadsheet applications.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p><a href="https://dataskeptic.com/">Data Skeptic</a> is a podcast about machine learning, data science, and how software affects our lives. The first guest on today’s episode is Kyle Polich, the host of <a href="https://dataskeptic.com/">Data Skeptic</a>. Kyle is one of the best explainers of machine learning concepts I have met, and for this episode, he presented some material that is perfect for this audience: machine learning for software engineers.</p><p><a href="https://www.secondspectrum.com/">Second Spectrum</a> is a company that analyzes data from professional sports, turning that data into visualizations, reports, and futuristic sports viewing experiences. We had a previous show about Second Spectrum where we went into the company in detail–it was an excellent show, so I wanted to have Kevin Squire, an engineer from Spectrum, come on the show to talk about how the company builds machine learning tools to analyze sports data. If you have not seen any of the visualizations from Second Spectrum, stop what you are doing and watch a video on it!</p><p>This year we have had three Software Engineering Daily Meetups: in New York, Boston, and Los Angeles. At each of these Meetups, listeners from the SE Daily community got to meet each other and talk about software–what they are building and what they are excited about. I was happy to be in attendance at each of these, and I am posting the talks given by our presenters. The audio quality is not perfect on these, but there are also no ads.</p><p>Thanks to Telesign for graciously providing a space and some delicious food for our Meetup. Telesign has beautiful offices in Los Angeles, and they make SMS, voice, and data solutions. If you are looking for secure and reliable communications APIs, check them out.</p><p>We’d love to have you as part of our community. We will have more Meetups eventually, and you can be notified of these by signing up for <a href="https://www.softwaredaily.com/register">our newsletter.</a> Come to SoftwareDaily.com and get involved with the discussion of episodes and software projects.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Moore’s Law states that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles about every two years. Moore’s Law is less like a “law” and more like an observation or a prediction.</p><p>Moore’s Law is ending. We can no longer fit an increasing amount of transistors in the same amount of space with a highly predictable rate. Dennard scaling is also coming to an end. Dennard scaling is the observation that as transistors get smaller, the power density stays constant.</p><p>These changes in hardware trends have downstream effects for software engineers. Most importantly–power consumption becomes much more important. </p><p>As a software engineer, how does power consumption affect you? It means that inefficient software will either run more slowly or cost more money relative to our expectations in the past. Whereas software engineers writing code 15 years ago could comfortably project that their code would get significantly cheaper to run over time due to hardware advances, the story is more complicated today.</p><p>Why is Moore’s Law ending? And what kinds of predictable advances in technology can we still expect?</p><p>John Hennessy is the chairman of Alphabet. In 2017, he won a Turing award (along with David Patterson) for his work on the RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Compiler) architecture. From 2000 to 2016, he was the president of Stanford University.</p><p>John joins the show to explore the future of computing. While we may not have the predictable benefits of Moore’s Law and Dennard scaling, we now have machine learning. It is hard to plot the advances of machine learning on any one chart (as we explored <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/06/04/openai-compute-and-safety-with-dario-amodei/">in a recent episode with OpenAI</a>). But we can say empirically that machine learning is working quite well in production.</p><p>If machine learning offers us such strong advances in computing, how can we change our hardware design process to make machine learning more efficient?</p><p>As machine learning training workloads eat up more resources in a data center, engineers are developing domain specific chips which are optimized for those machine learning workloads. The Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) from Google is one such example. John mentioned that chips could become even more specialized within the domain of machine learning. You could imagine a chip that is specifically designed for a LSTM machine learning model.</p><p>There are other domains where we could see specialized chips–drones, self-driving cars, wearable computers. In this episode, John describes his perspective on the future of computing, and offers some framework for how engineers can adapt to that future.</p><p>Transcript provided by We Edit Podcasts.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>When Box started in 2006, the small engineering team had a lot to learn. Box was one of the earliest cloud storage companies, with a product that allowed companies to securely upload files to remote storage. </p><p>This was two years before Amazon Web Services introduced on-demand infrastructure, so the Box team managed their own servers, which they learned how to do as they went along. In the early days, the backup strategy was not so sophisticated. The founders did not know how to properly set up hardware in a colocated data center. The frontend interface was not the most beautiful product.</p><p>But the product was so useful that eventually it started to catch on. Box’s distributed file system became the backbone of many enterprises. Employees began to use it to interact with and share data across organizations. </p><p>The increase in usage raised the stakes for Box’s small engineering team. If Box’s service went down, it could cripple an enterprise’s productivity, which meant that Box needed to hire experienced engineers to build resilient systems with higher availability. And to accommodate the growth in usage, Box needed to predict how much hardware to purchase, and how much space in a data center to rent–a process known as capacity planning.</p><p>As Box went from 3 engineers to 300, the different areas of the company went from being managed by individuals, to teams, to entire departments with VPs and C-level executives. </p><p>Jeff Quiesser is an SVP at Box, and one of the earliest employees. He joins the show today to describe how Box changed as the company scaled. We covered engineering, management, operations, and culture.</p><p>In previous shows, we have explored the stories of companies like Slack, Digital Ocean, Giphy, Uber, Tinder, and Spotify.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>React is a set of open source tools for building user interfaces. React was open sourced by Facebook, and includes libraries for creating interfaces on the web (ReactJS) and on mobile devices (React Native).</p><p>React was released during a time when there was not a dominant frontend JavaScript library. Backbone, Angular, and other JavaScript frameworks were all popular, but there was not any consolidation across the frontend web development community. Before React came out, frontend developers were fractured into different communities for the different JavaScript frameworks. </p><p>After Facebook open sourced React, web developers began to gravitate towards the framework for its one-way data flow and its unconventional style of putting JavaScript and HTML together in a format called JSX. As React has grown in popularity, the React ecosystem has developed network effects. In many cases, the easiest way to build a web application frontend is to compose together open source React components.</p><p>After seeing the initial traction, Facebook invested heavily into React, creating entire teams within the company whose goal was to improve React.

A human enters an unstructured query into the search box, the search engine provides several links as a result, and the human clicks on one of those links. That link brings up a web page, which is a set of unstructured data. Humans can read and understand news articles, videos, and Wikipedia pages.</p><p>Google Search solves the problem of organizing and distributing all of the unstructured data across the web, for humans to consume. Diffbot is a company with a goal of solving a related, but distinctly different problem: how to derive structure from the unstructured web, understand relationships within that structure, and allow machines to utilize those relationships through APIs.</p><p>Mike Tung is the founder of Diffbot. He joins the show to talk about the last decade that he has spent building artificial intelligence applications, from his research at Stanford to a mature, widely used product in Diffbot. I have built a few applications with Diffbot, and I encourage anyone who is a tinkerer or prototype builder to play around with it. It’s an API for accessing web pages as structured data.</p><p>Diffbot crawls the entire web, parsing websites, using NLP and NLU to comprehend those pages, and using probabilistic estimations to draw relationships between entities. It’s an ambitious product, and Mike has been working on it for a long time. I enjoyed our conversation.</p><p><em>We recently launched a new podcast: Fintech Daily!

These systems can sometimes tolerate data loss, because the data they are gathering is used for monitoring and other applications that require aggregated data sets rather than highly important individual transactions.</p><p>The demand for time series databases has grown over the last decade with the rise of mobile devices and the decreasing cost of cloud storage. There has been an increase in the number of systems that require monitoring, and some of those systems produce an incredibly large amount of data, requiring compression, downsampling, and garbage collection.</p><p>Rob Skillington is an engineer at Uber, where he helped create M3DB, a time series database.

At Amazon, one of the core company values is “bias for action.” As an engineer, you are often in a situation where you can wait for more information, or you can start a project with an incomplete picture for how you will finish it. The “bias for action” lets you know that you should usually start the project despite having an incomplete picture.</p><p>Another use of a company values system is for hiring.</p><p>When a company publishes their values, prospective employees can use those stated values as a way to know if they would be a good cultural fit. For example “move fast and break things” was a value that allowed Facebook to ship new products faster than any other company before it. But the speed of movement is not for everyone. Some engineers like to have their code unit tested, and free of all bugs before shipping to production.</p><p>Every company has values that define their company. And every engineer has values that define how they want to work.</p><p>Lynne Tye started her company Key Values as a platform to index companies by their values systems. This allows engineers to find companies that are a good cultural fit for their values system. Lynne joins the show today to explain how engineers and companies define their values systems, and how that affects the outcomes of engineering organizations.</p><p>Lynne also talks about her time at HomeJoy, one of the first companies in the “gig economy”. HomeJoy was an on-demand house cleaning service that grew extremely fast, but ultimately went under due to lawsuits. The challenges of HomeJoy were a predictor of the challenges later faced by Uber and Airbnb, and it was fascinating to hear Lynne reflect on her time spent managing operations at HomeJoy–which was about as operationally intensive a company as you can imagine!</p><p>Thanks to Courtland Allen for the intro to Lynne, and if you haven’t checked out the Indie Hackers podcast, which is hosted by Courtland, you should subscribe to it. Indie Hackers breaks down the engineering and business models behind small software companies–it’s one of my favorite shows.</p><p>Transcript provided by We Edit Podcasts.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>The Internet is decreasing in privacy and increasing in utility. Under some conditions, this tradeoff makes sense. We publicize our profile photo so that people know what we look like. Under other conditions, this tradeoff does not make sense. We do not want a television that costs less to purchase because it is silently recording all of the conversations that take place in the room and selling them to the highest bidder.</p><p>The example of the TV that records everything you say <a href="http://www.snopes.com/2016/02/12/samsung-smart-tvs-spying/">(which is a real thing)</a> illustrates a tradeoff of the Internet. The advertising industry pushes us towards lower marginal costs for products and services in exchange for less privacy.</p><p>Someday we will live in a world where it will be easy for consumers to control the dial on the tradeoff between privacy and the price of their services. Until then, we have almost zero control over what information the advertising surveillance industrial complex knows about us.</p><p>Bill Budington is a security engineer with the Electronic Frontier Foundation. In today’s episode, Bill describes some of the current techniques used by the advertising industry to track your activity through the web. Bill works on encryption tools as well as Panopticlick, a project that allows users to see what trackers they are vulnerable to.</p><p>Software Engineering Daily is having our third Meetup, Wednesday May 3rd at Galvanize in San Francisco. The theme of this Meetup is Fraud and Risk in Software. We will have great food, engaging speakers, and a friendly, intellectual atmosphere.

Tools can be overhyped, buzzwords can be overemphasized, and people can forget the fundamentals.</p><p>If you have bad data, you will get bad results in your experimentation. If you don’t know what statistical approach you want to take to your data, it doesn’t matter how well you know Spark or TensorFlow. And if you aren’t passionate about the work you are doing, you are unlikely to finish the projects you start (whether we are talking data science or otherwise).</p><p>Kyle Polich hosts the Data Skeptic podcast, a show at the intersection of data science and skepticism.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>When Facebook was scaling in its early years, the company developed engineering practices that were unlike any other organization before it.</p><p>Early Facebook engineering developed unusual practices because the problem set was unusual. Facebook was a highly detailed, highly interactive, multi-user web application. Facebook was pushing the limits of PHP and JavaScript in a time when there were not simple frameworks to help with user interface development and data fetching.</p><p>In addition to unique engineering problems, the Facebook product itself was also unique. When a product has as much traction as Facebook did in the early days, how are you supposed to manage the direction of that product?</p><p>Should you double down on the core competency of the product, and make it as good as possible at simply connecting friends to each other? Or should you rapidly expand into adjacent systems like messaging, groups, and photos? How should you allocate developer resources when you have problems to be solved at every layer of the stack, from backend infrastructure to frontend performance?</p><p>At a typical company, you would put all these engineering problems and product opportunities into some kind of project management software and assign developers to work on them, and gradually make steady, measured progress. The downside of that approach is that it slows down the pace of product creation and experimentation, and turns software development into a top-down, bureaucratic process.</p><p>At Facebook, developers self-assembled into teams that did what needed to be done. The engineers who were the most productive and charismatic could quickly build a reputation for themselves and become technical leaders. These “influencer engineers” within Facebook had a proven track record, and would become magnets for other engineers who wanted to contribute to the projects with the most momentum.</p><p>Facebook is a case study in the ability for developers to self-organize into groups who are working on projects that are meaningful to the company and personally satisfying to the individual engineers. Many engineers in the software industry work under a less capable manager who has complete control over their creativity. This leads to employee churn, dissatisfaction, and burnout.</p><p>Facebook’s ability to move fast is predicated on its ability to match engineers with problems that are interesting to those particular individuals. Whether you want to work on newsfeed or developer productivity tools or machine learning research, there is a path within Facebook to finding a problem that is both important and fun.</p><p>Facebook’s unique set of engineering challenges required the company to develop a unique set of internal tools. Because Facebook had data and throughput requirements which were unprecedented, the available tools and best practices at the time did not satisfy Facebook’s requirements. Over the years, Facebook has developed its own databases, caching strategies, and JavaScript frameworks.</p><p>Nick Schrock worked at Facebook for eight years. He is best known as a co-creator of GraphQL, a tool for efficiently fetching data through a federated request language. GraphQL was the result of years of evolution of internal tooling within Facebook.</p><p>Nick has discussed the creation of GraphQL in other podcasts, and we will have a more dedicated episode around a retrospective of GraphQL in the near future. Today’s episode is about the process by which developers at Facebook self-organized, and Nick’s ideas around how to identify a need for an internal tool.</p><p>Since leaving Facebook, Nick has parlayed his experience in developer tools into <a href="https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster">Dagster</a>, a programming model for data applications.</p><p>RECENT UPDATES:</p><p><a href="http://findcollabs.com/open">The FindCollabs Open has started. It is our second FindCollabs hackathon, and we are giving away $2500 in prizes. The prizes will be awarded in categories such as machine learning, business plan, music, visual art, and JavaScript.

A chicken farmer needs to count the number of eggs produced.</p><p>If this data is captured, it can be acted upon—for example, a dry farm can automatically turn up its irrigation system. Or the data can simply be studied. </p><p>If you work in a pure software business, you might take for granted how easy it is to track your metrics. On the farm, you need to use sensors and drones to gather your data.</p><p>Mike Prorock is the CTO of Mesur.io, a company that makes sensors and software infrastructure for agriculture. He joins the show to describe the use cases for agriculture technology, and the architecture behind it.</p><p>Today’s episode is a great complement to our recent episodes on streaming data.

By aggregating demand for electronics prototyping, Tempo Automation can offer competitive pricing and speed to anyone who needs a hardware prototype.</p><p>I visited Tempo Automation and was given a tour of the production floor by CEO Jeff McAlvay. He showed me the huge machines that are used to build hardware prototypes and explained how they work in serial to produce prototypes. He also mentioned that anyone can schedule a tour of Tempo Automation’s factory by going to <a href="http://www.tempoautomation.com">their website</a>, and I highly recommend it.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Different browsers consume JavaScript in different ways. </p><p>When a new version of JavaScript comes out, developers are eager to use the new functionality of that language version. But if you are writing frontend JavaScript code, that code needs to be interpretable by every browser that might consume it–whether the consumer is on an iPhone running Safari or a Windows machine running Internet Explorer 11.</p><p>Babel is a transpiler for JavaScript. Babel allows new versions of JavaScript to be consumed by older browsers by translating new language features of JavaScript into code that is readable by an older JavaScript interpreter. Babel does this by parsing JavaScript code, creating an abstract syntax tree, and manipulating the AST to make that code comply with the old browser.</p><p>Henry Zhu is a core maintainer of Babel and a full-time open source developer. In today’s episode, Henry explains how Babel works and its various applications. He also talks about life as a full-time open source developer, where he earns a living through Patreon and OpenCollective.</p><p>Transcript provided by We Edit Podcasts.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Andreas Antonopoulos is the author of several books about cryptocurrency engineering, including <em><a href="https://bitcoinbook.info/">Mastering Bitcoin</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Ethereum-Building-Smart-Contracts/dp/1491971940">Mastering Ethereum</a></em>. In these books, Andreas lays out the systems of economics and computer science that underpin the two most mature decentralized monetary systems.</p><p>When Andreas originally discovered the Bitcoin whitepaper, he had witnessed the repeated mismanagement of government-backed fiat currencies. Andreas has a Greek background, and the financial collapse of 2008 had led to an economic crisis in Greece. His firsthand observation of the weaknesses of centrally planned government currencies, together with a degree in computer science and distributed systems have made him a dedicated evangelist for Bitcoin.</p><p>Andreas joins the show to discuss the Bitcoin ecosystem, and the relationship between decentralized cryptoeconomic systems and centralized corporations. Facebook has recently announced a cryptocurrency project called Libra, and Andreas suggests that Libra changes everything–not necessarily because Libra will make it to production, or because Libra itself will upend the world of finance–but because it allows us to further call into question the very nature of what makes a modern currency valuable and valid. </p><p>After all, if a large government has the right to back a currency, why shouldn’t a large corporation have that same privilege?</p><p>Andreas is also a co-host of one of my favorite Bitcoin podcasts, <a href="https://letstalkbitcoin.com/blog/category/episodes">Let’s Talk Bitcoin</a>.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>The software release process is a barrier between written code and a live production environment that affects users. A software release process can involve a variety of different practices. Code might be tested for bugs using automation and manual testing. Static analysis tools can look at the code for potential memory leaks. A software release might go out to a small percentage of the total user base before it gets deployed to the entire audience.</p><p>At some organizations, a software release can be slow and painful. The release might be bottlenecked by a manual approval step, which slows down developers from quickly deploying their own changes. If a consistent version history of software is not maintained, a release can be hard to roll back in the event of an error. In the case of a large, monolithic architecture, a release can be scary, because it can be hard to understand how the monolithic codebase functions.</p><p>This set of challenges within the release process lowers the quality of software, and can make it frustrating to build software. The release process is just one area of software development that many organizations have a desire to smooth out.</p><p>Over the past ten years, a set of technologies and philosophies have provided improvements to the software development process. DevOps, continuous delivery, microservices, cloud providers, and serverless tools all make it easier for a company to focus on its core competency and release software faster.</p><p>Baruch Sadogursky is an author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Liquid-Software-Achieve-Trusted-Continuous/dp/1981855726">Liquid Software</a>, a book about continuous updates and DevOps. Liquid Software describes an idealized vision of what today’s architecture could aspire to. The focus of the book is continuous updates, which allow for rapidly improving, evolving software quality. Baruch joins the show to discuss how software has changed in the last twenty years, and how the future of software development could look.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>“Management is about human beings. Its task is to make people capable of joint performance. To make their strengths effective and their weaknesses irrelevant.” That quote is from Peter Drucker.</p><p>It is one of the many useful quotes collected in Ron Lichty’s book “Managing the Unmanageable”—and it illustrates why we work in teams. When we collaborate with each other, we make each other’s strengths effective, and our weaknesses become irrelevant.</p><p>To collaborate effectively, we need leaders. We need management.</p><p>Ron Lichty spent 6 years managing engineers at Apple, and many more years in management and director roles elsewhere. In his book, Ron lays out the lessons he learned in 30 years of engineering management. Ron also describes concrete strategies for how to manage engineers productively.</p><p>An engineer who becomes a manager needs to learn new skills. And the hardest skills to master have nothing to do with technology.</p><p>Prioritizing the right projects, allocating engineering resources, making architectural decisions—all of those skills are important. But the art of relationships—of diplomacy and language—is harder to learn than any technical skill.</p><p>How do you motivate an engineer to do something that is boring? How do you have a difficult conversation with an engineer who needs to improve?  When a conflict between engineers comes up, do you confront the conflict head-on, or do you wait for those engineers to resolve it among themselves?</p><p>These questions do not have easy answers. The best way to learn how to react to these situations is to live through them. The second best way to learn is to read and listen to people who have seen so much of the management dynamic that they can distill it into anecdotes and aphorisms.</p><p>In today’s show, Ron shares several stories that changed how I think about management.</p><p>Ron and I did not have time to discuss everything I wanted to, and I recommend checking out his <a href="http://www.se-radio.net/2017/10/se-radio-episode-306-ron-lichty-on-managing-programmers/">podcast episode on Software Engineering Radio</a> for more detail.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Software products are distributed across more and more servers as they grow. With the proliferation of cloud providers like <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/10/19/aws-containers-with-deepak-singh/">AWS</a>, these large infrastructure deployments have become much easier to create. With the maturity of <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/08/30/kubernetes-impact/">Kubernetes</a>, these distributed applications are more reliable.</p><p>Developers and operators can use a service mesh to manage the interactions between services across this distributed application.</p><p>A service mesh is a layer across a distributed microservices application that consists of service proxy sidecars running alongside each service in a cluster, along with a central control plane for communicating with those sidecar proxies.</p><p>A service mesh has many uses. Every request and response within the application gets routed through the service proxy, which can improve observability, traffic control to different instances, and circuit breaking in case of an instance failure. The central control plane can be used manage network policy throughout the whole system.</p><p>We have done shows about each of the different components of a service mesh system, including different types of service proxies, as well as the service meshes built on top of these proxies.</p><p>Linkerd, which is made by the startup Buoyant, was the first service mesh product to come to market, and it has the most production use, with customers like Expedia and <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/06/25/build-a-bank-monzo-with-richard-dingwall/">Monzo</a> bank. <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/11/26/istio-routing-basics/">Istio</a> is a more recent service mesh which uses the Envoy service proxy. Istio came out of Google and is also supported by <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2017/11/29/how-ibm-runs-its-cloud-with-jason-mcgee/">IBM</a>—setting up a classic competition between a startup and the large incumbents.</p><p>William Morgan is the CEO of Buoyant, and he joins the show to talk about the use cases and adoption of service mesh. He also talks about the business landscape of the service mesh category, and how to compete with giant cloud providers.</p>',

The infamous “fail whale” could happen as a result of problems in the application servers, the network, or the database layer. </p><p>When Twitter was scaling in its early days, the cloud providers were still immature. Engineers did not have access to the autoscaling cloud infrastructure that is available today. The early Twitter architecture was a combination of open source tools and internally created infrastructure custom built for Twitter’s workloads.</p><p>Evan Weaver was an early engineer at Twitter, and he saw the deficiencies of the data tools that the company had access to. Twitter engineers wanted access to a truly reusable data platform that would fit Twitter’s requirements: high availability, globally replicated, and transactionally consistent.</p><p>By 2012, Evan had left Twitter and started consulting for other technology companies. He found that databases across the industry were lacking the same properties that Twitter wanted, and the ideas for FaunaDB began to percolate. Around this time, there were two relevant papers about distributed databases that had come out: the Spanner paper from Google and the Calvin paper, a distributed systems paper from Yale.</p><p>With inspiration from the literature, his time at Twitter, and his knowledge from consulting, Evan started FaunaDB. Seven years later, FaunaDB is a fully fledged open source project as well as a database company with a cloud service offering. Fauna is an OLTP database used by companies like Nvidia, Nextdoor, and Capital One.</p><p>Evan joins the show to talk about his time spent scaling Twitter and the architecture of FaunaDB.</p>',

Newer “fintech” companies have created innovative ways of doing everything related to money–from friendly payments to budgeting; from business transactions to insurance. However, the traditional banks themselves have been relatively slow at adjusting to these digital changes, creating the opportunity for native digital banks–often referred to as “challenger banks.”</p><p>N26 is a digital first bank established in Berlin and is active in 17 European countries with a million users. Pat Kua is the CTO at N26. </p><p>Digital banks are hosted on the cloud, without a physical branch the user must go to to perform an operation. The user accesses their account through a mobile application, and can complete everything online from opening an account to performing transactions. This system has numerous advantages, like simplicity for the user, and higher scalability in terms of users from the bank’s perspective. </p><p>In this episode, we discuss the advantages of digital banks, the fintech industry and N26 as a itself. We also explore product development and how Pat manages his time as CTO–which is a useful discussion for anyone who is learning to be a technical leader or manager.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Sue Loh is a software engineer and author of a book with the goal of breaking developer stereotypes. Stereotyping among developers leads to bad outcomes. When incorrect assumptions are made about certain populations, those populations feel marginalized and engineering resources get misallocated.</p><p>From the perspective of Sue, the main problem is about how children are socialized. Young girls in particular are discouraged from programming, leading to a steady decline in the percentage of women in the computing workforce. With her book, Sue is hoping to create a piece of literature that will expose young female and minority students to the world of technology, and help them realize how cool engineering can be. Sue created a Kickstarter around her book, and has raised more than $40,000. </p><p>Sue also describes her experiences as an engineer who has risen through the ranks at Microsoft, and how her perspective on engineering has evolved as she has become a principal engineer.</p><p>Transcript provided by We Edit Podcasts.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>WebAssembly is a binary instruction format for applications to run in a memory-constrained, stack-based virtual machine. The WebAssembly ecosystem consists of tools and projects that allow programs in a variety of languages to compile into WebAssembly and run in a safe, fast, sandboxed runtime environment.</p><p>WebAssembly is a transformative technology for the Internet. Most users will experience it as a set of gradual, incremental improvements to their online experiences. Pages will load faster and become more dynamic. Applications will become more secure. Infrastructure will become cheaper, and those cost savings will eventually reach the consumer.</p><p>For developers, WebAssembly opens a world of possibility. In today’s operating systems, the user can feel a big difference between applications that need a large client-side runtime (such as video editing tools, or render-heavy games such as Half Life) and applications that are more lightweight and can run entirely on the web (such as Twitter).</p><p>Tyler McMullen is the CTO at Fastly. He joins the show to talk about the compilation path, the runtime, and the opportunities of WebAssembly.</p><p>RECENT UPDATES:</p><p><a href="http://findcollabs.com">FindCollabs is a company I started recently</a></p><p><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/findcollabs-podcast/id1460158612">The FindCollabs Podcast is out!</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/software_daily/status/1119317663233167360">FindCollabs is hiring a React developer</a></p><p><a href="http://findcollabs.com/hackathon">FindCollabs Hackathon #1 has ended!</a> Congrats to <a href="https://findcollabs.com/project/EiZppbiwlpHfBgbC0ADq">ARhythm</a>, <a href="https://findcollabs.com/project/v7vWqpkRKz5UHupMEqou">Kitspace</a>, and <a href="https://findcollabs.com/project/GqVSH5vz30pXotNNOf71">Rivaly</a> for winning 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place ($4,000, $1000, and a set of SE Daily hoodies, respectively).

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>For most of history, a typical musician would learn to play one specific instrument. As synthesizers became available to the public, it became commonplace for a musician to create their own instruments using hardware and software. By the early 2000s, digital audio workstation software allowed a musician with a laptop to have access to the tools of a record producer. These tools changed how music is made, and gave rise to new genres.</p><p>Creating electronic music on the computer is a practice much like software engineering. Iteration, modularity, and software architecture skills are required to build a song intelligently. Music engineering also requires working at numerous levels of abstraction: the synthesizer level, the song arrangement level, the mixer level, and the design of melodies.</p><p>Dom Kane is a musician and sound engineer who writes music for mau5trap, a label started by deadmau5. He has built software synthesizers, worked with numerous artists as a producer, and written music for film and TV. He joins the show to talk about working as a professional electronic musician. We also talk about the overlap between engineering and the different facets of crafting modern music on the computer.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Airbnb began in 2008 as a monolithic Rails application serving the simple purpose of listing homes for rental. Over time, the number of listings increased dramatically, as did the number of people who were renting.</p><p>With that scale, the Rails app had to be broken into different services, and entire teams were built out to focus on challenges such as pricing, application infrastructure, and search. Surabhi Gupta joined in 2013 to work on the search team, and has worked on different teams at Airbnb over time.</p><p>Today she is a director of engineering leading the Homes business for Airbnb, which includes Growth, Search, Hosts, Pricing, and Business Travel. Surabhi has helped scale Airbnb through a hypergrowth period, and joins the show to share those experiences. One distinct area that we spent time on was Airbnb’s search engine. Surabhi formerly worked at Google, and she described how the engineering problem of a search engine for homes differs from a general purpose search engine like Google.</p>',

    'Episodes Pubdate Date': '2017-12-19',
    'Episodes Summary': '<p><em>The New York Times</em> makes most of its money off of subscriptions. Facebook makes its money off of native advertising. Hacker News is funded by Y-Combinator. Each of these business models creates biases in the information that gets promoted on the respective platforms.</p><p>This is why I like to know the origin story and the business models behind the publications that I read. Published content is shaped by the profit motive of the publication. </p><p>And yet, last month, I repeatedly found myself reading high quality content on a Medium publication that I did not know the origin of: Hacker Noon. Hacker Noon is a popular Medium publication that syndicates curated content written about software.</p><p>Let me explain “syndication.” Imagine that I just spent three days on a Medium post about functional programming, and I have zero followers on social media. How can I get people to read awesome post? The answer is syndication. I can submit my Medium post to Hacker Noon. This gives me free distribution, and it gives Hacker Noon free content—a win-win relationship.</p><p>But why was it worth it for Hacker Noon to spend time curating content? That syndication process takes time. You have to read through lots of submissions, sometimes you have to send it back to the author to have it edited. And this is all to build a following on Medium. I have not heard of Medium being a profitable platform to build a business.</p><p>It’s worth pointing out the difference between Medium and WordPress.</p><p>On WordPress, this model of curated syndication has worked to massive success—for example, the <em>Huffington Post</em> and TechCrunch. These businesses make millions of dollars from advertising networks, because they are built on WordPress, and WordPress is an open model.</p><p>A publisher on WordPress can install plugins that serve ads from third party providers like Outbrain and Taboola. A WordPress site can also install any kind of data collection scripts, to gather data on visitors, and sell it to the highest bidder.</p><p>The lack of third party plugins is the blessing and the curse of Medium. </p><p>Because there is no third party ecosystem, reading content on Medium is a beautiful experience. The page loads quickly and predictably. There are no random scripts that are blocking the page as they hog your browser’s resources. When you go to close the page, there is never a popup that asks you to subscribe to a newsletter.</p><p>When I read content on Medium, I am not getting slapped across the face with ads for reverse mortgages and açaí berries. I am not being tagged for retargeting. It’s a beautiful experience. But Medium seems like an ecosystem that would not allow for the content syndication business like Hacker Noon.</p><p>I wanted to know who was running Hacker Noon, how the business works, and what it says about Medium as a publishing platform.</p><p>Hacker Noon turns out to be part of a network of Medium publications called AMI. AMI’s network includes sites like <a href="https://artplusmarketing.com/">Art + Marketing</a>, <a href="https://futuretravel.today/">Future Travel</a>, and <a href="https://fityourself.club/">Fit Yourself Club</a>–all of which are distinct syndication platforms. David Smooke is the CEO of AMI, and he joins this episode to explain how his business works, how he has scaled the content syndication business, and why he is betting on Medium. It was a detailed look into the state of online publishing and where it might be headed.</p><p>If you don’t read Hacker Noon already, one article to start with that shows off the quality of content is <a href="https://hackernoon.com/learn-blockchains-by-building-one-117428612f46">Learn Blockchains By Building One</a>. I interviewed the author of that article, Daniel Van Flymen, and it has been <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2017/10/12/blockchain-building-with-daniel-van-flymen/">one of the most popular episodes of Software Engineering Daily</a>.</p><p>Transcript provided by We Edit Podcasts.

Parse had several novel engineering challenges. In 2011, it was not easy to build on top of AWS, nor was it easy to build within the young mobile ecosystem.</p><p>Charity Majors was an early engineer at Parse, and stayed with the company through its acquisition by Facebook. Charity joins the show to discuss her experience at Parse and her reflections on being part of Facebook after the acquisition. Parse was shut down in 2017, which was a disappointing outcome for Charity.</p><p>Charity currently works as the CTO of Honeycomb. <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2017/03/01/parse-and-operations-with-charity-majors/">In a previous episode, Charity gave some background on her career in software, as well as her perspective on modern problems in observability and DevOps</a>. In this episode, Charity tells the story of joining Parse, working through novel engineering problems, and the feeling of being acquired by a company where she did not feel like a great cultural fit.</p><p>It is a useful conversation for anyone interested in engineering culture, company philosophy, and the realities of acquisitions–which can be both painful and profitable for the acquired employees.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Rust is a systems level language that is built to prevent crashes and eliminate data races. A language like C++ gives you high speed and lots of control, but it is easy to have segfaults, data races, and other problems if you aren’t careful. On this spectrum of control versus safety, we can plot other languages like Java, Go, and Haskell–but none of these languages have the unique feature set of Rust.</p><p>Rust’s concurrency model is built on the foundation of ownership–a piece of data can only be owned by a single thing at a time. In today’s interview, Alex Crichton explains ownership, and the other abstractions that give Rust its unique model of concurrency.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Infrastructure software can be a great business. </p><p>An infrastructure software company sells core technology to a large enterprise such as a bank or insurance company. This software has near zero marginal cost and generates a large annuity for the infrastructure software company. Once a bank has purchased your infrastructure software, the bank is likely to renew every year and never remove the software.</p><p>Selling infrastructure software is like selling concrete or steel, except the software is cheaper to produce, easier to distribute, and generates an annuity rather than being a one-time sale.</p><p>The fundamental economics of enterprise infrastructure software are extremely appealing, and every year more businesses enter the space–but few businesses ever leave. If you are starting an infrastructure software company, you can expect a complex battle for market share. There is no easy trick to get it into the hands of your target customer.</p><p>Martin Casado studied computer science at Stanford before founding Nicira, a company that pioneered software-defined networking and virtualization technology. In 2012, Nicira sold to VMware for $1.26 billion. Martin now works as a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz.</p><p>Martin writes about the modern strategies of building a successful infrastructure software company. <a href="https://a16z.com/2018/12/11/bottom-up-adoption-enterprise-sales-combined/">He describes two methods of selling into an enterprise: bottoms-up and top-down</a>. </p><p>In a bottoms-up model, engineers within an enterprise start using your product to solve a well-defined problem, <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2019/01/04/kong-api-platform-with-marco-palladino/">such as API management</a>. As more and more employees within the organization start to use your product, you can begin to engage the enterprise about becoming a paying customer for your product. Since the enterprise is already using your product, the sales conversation is much easier.</p><p>In the top-down model, you engage the CIO, CEO, or CTO directly and try to convince them that your product is worth paying for. When the senior leadership of a bank buys into your product idea, you can count on that senior leadership to convince their developers to use your product within the bank.</p><p>It is a rare occurrence that your infrastructure software company will be able to fit cleanly into either of these models–bottoms-up or top-down. More often, there will be some bottoms-up usage, and some top-down buy-in for your product. But you will have to evangelize the product on all fronts. You will have to convince both the engineers and the senior leadership. </p><p>Your product probably won’t speak for itself. <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/12/18/market-strategy-with-herb-cunitz/">You will have to develop expertise in sales, marketing, and consultancy</a>. And in many cases, you might end up in an <a href="http://a16z.com/2018/12/27/endless-chasm-enterprise-startups/">unending chasm</a>.</p><p>The unending chasm describes a mode in which an infrastructure company must function as both a product company and a consultancy. Your consultancy is necessary to integrate your product into the enterprise, and ensure that your software actually gets used. But it reduces the appealing economics of a pure software company. </p><p>The unending chasm does not prevent you from being successful. Companies who have had very successful IPOs remain in the unending chasm. But it’s useful to know whether you are heading for an unending chasm–or if you are already in one.</p><p>Martin Casado joins the show today for a discussion of product development, software engineering, and <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/09/07/go-to-market-with-mitch-ferguson/">go-to-market strategy.</a></p><p>To find all 900 of our episodes, including past episodes with a16z partners, check out the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/software-engineering-daily/id1253734426?mt=8">Software Engineering Daily app in the iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.koalatea.sedaily">Android app stores</a>.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>The Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) was a digital form of venture capital. It was an ambitious idea–to provide a new decentralized business model for organizing corporations on top of the Ethereum blockchain.

The following month, the DAO was hacked, millions of dollars of Ether were stolen, and the reverberations of the event were a referendum on how the Ethereum community governs itself.</p><p>Matt Leising is a reporter for Bloomberg who has chronicled the DAO in his article <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2017-the-ether-thief/">The Ether Thief</a>.

As a teenager, Haseeb played poker professionally through the online poker bubble. His path from poker to software entrepreneurship has been explored in previous episodes.</p><p>In 2007, Haseeb and I met at an online poker table. As we battled each other for thousands of dollars, Haseeb and I realized we shared an affinity for obnoxious screen names, obnoxious online avatars, and the city of Austin, Texas. We were both living in the city, and met each other in the real world. </p><p>In our earliest days, Haseeb and I were not friends. It was a strange time–we were disembodied minds, drifting on the Internet, attached mostly to the fluctuating balances of our Full Tilt Poker and Pokerstars accounts. This was not a time for friendship–it was a time for ruthless, modern competition. </p><p>Throughout the history of poker, alliances have always been fickle. And online, backstabbing and deception was an art that had been barely explored. Any true friendship was a missed opportunity to exploit a competitor.</p><p>The duplicity of the online poker world knew no limits, and our sheltered, posh existence of teenagers with great parents, food on the table every evening, and no reason to worry became shattered by the daily tumult of complete financial instability.</p><p>Online poker was in a bubble. In the early days of a bubble, success comes easy. You have to be a fool to fail. When a bubble pops, the ocean washes back to the sea, and we see who is left without any clothing.</p><p>The poker bust wiped me out. Not just financially, but emotionally. In a month, I lost hundreds of thousands of dollars, and I lost my identity. After doing nothing but playing poker for years, what was I left with? What durable skills had I developed? What friends did I have to turn to? What was my ideology? What was my vision for my own future?</p><p>As I plummeted into despair, Haseeb rose like a meteor through the world of heads up poker, thriving on the rise in popularity of pot limit Omaha, a game whose theoretical complexity suited Haseeb better than the rudimentary game of no limit hold’em. The bigger the stacks, the bigger the decision trees, and the bigger the decision trees, the more edge Haseeb had over his opponents.</p><p>As a professional poker player, regardless of whether you succeed or fail, the banality of what you are actually doing eventually catches up to you. The best players are able to put an athletic framing to the game. Yes, you are competing on a zero sum basis, with a 52 card deck that was invented last century. Yes, your innovation is measured in the smallest increment of invention. But in some ways, that is the beauty of the game. We don’t need a revolution in the game of basketball, because to appreciate the dynamic of basketball is to appreciate the dynamic of humans. And the same can be said of poker.</p><p>Unfortunately, the successful online poker player must eventually have their own reality shattered. Because to be a successful poker player, you must be rigorous and critical. You will eventually be forced to step back and say: “what is this thing I’m doing every day? How have I become hooked to a screen? I don’t know how that screen works. What are these numbers? Are they fabricated? How do they control my emotions so thoroughly? Who is running this thing?”</p><p>Haseeb grew tired of poker. He wrote a book about the game to memorialize his thoughts, then abandoned it. He studied philosophy and literature, searching for something new in the historical musings of humanity. He traveled Europe, working as a farmer to reconnect with the physical world. He discovered the Effective Altruism movement.</p><p>Finding no solace in his poker spoils, Haseeb gave away most of his money and started from scratch. As he rebuilt himself, he found software engineering and charted a path to San Francisco, where we reconnected.</p><p>In this episode, Haseeb joins me for a discussion of software, philosophy, poker, and the nature of bubbles. Indeed, Haseeb and I have now lived through four major bubbles: dot coms, poker, the 2008 financial crisis, and the crypto bubble. Throughout these bubbles, the mediums change but never does the message: human beings are deeply irrational, tribalistic, and emotional.</p>',

Modern cloud applications are built using more sophisticated tools like Redis, Kafka, or Amazon S3. These tools do multiple things well, and often have overlapping functionality. Application architecture becomes less straightforward.</p><p>The applications we are building today are data-intensive rather than compute-intensive. Netflix needs to know how to store and cache large video files, and stream them to users quickly. Twitter needs to update user news feeds with a fanout of the president’s latest tweet. These operations are simple with small amounts of data, but become complicated with a high volume of users.</p><p>Martin Kleppmann is the author of <em>Data Intensive Applications</em>, an O’Reilly book about how to use modern data tools to solve modern data problems.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Oliver Gould worked at Twitter from 2010 to 2014. Twitter’s popularity was taking off, and the engineering team was learning how to scale the product. </p><p>During that time, Twitter adopted Apache Mesos, and began breaking up its monolithic architecture into different services. As more and more services were deployed, engineers at Twitter decided to standardize communications between those services with a tool called a service proxy. </p><p>A service proxy provides each service with features that every service would want: load balancing, routing, service discovery, retries, and visibility. It turns out that lots of other companies wanted this service proxy technology as well, which is why Oliver left Twitter to start Buoyant, a company that was focused on developing software around the service proxy–and eventually the service mesh.</p><p>If you are unfamiliar with service proxies and service mesh, check out our previous shows on <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/?s=linkerd">Linkerd</a>, <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2017/02/14/service-proxying-with-matt-klein/">Envoy</a>, and <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/tag/istio/">Istio</a>.</p><p>Kubernetes is often deployed with a service mesh. A service mesh consists of two parts: the data plane and the control plane. </p><p>The “data plane” refers to the sidecar containers that are deployed to each of your Kubernetes application pods. Each sidecar has a service proxy. The “control plane” refers to a central service that aggregates data from across the data plane and can send communications to the service proxies sitting across that control plane.</p><p>The Linkerd service mesh was built in Java, and the project started before Kubernetes had become the standard for container orchestration. More recently, Buoyant built Conduit, a service mesh built using Rust and Go. </p><p>In this episode, we explore how to design a service mesh and what Oliver learned in his experience building Linkerd and Conduit.</p><p>Transcript provided by We Edit Podcasts.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>If I have a picture of a dog, and I want to search the Internet for pictures that look like that dog, how can I do that? </p><p>I need to make an algorithm to build an index of all the pictures on the Internet. That index can define the different features of my images. I can find mathematical features in each image that describe that image. The mathematical features can be represented by a matrix of numbers. Then I can run the same algorithm on the picture of my dog, which will make another matrix of numbers. I can compare the matrix representing my dog picture to the matrices of all the pictures on the internet.</p><p>This is what Google and Facebook do–and we covered this topic<a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2017/08/22/similarity-search-with-jeff-johnson/"> in our episode about similarity search</a> a few weeks ago.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Computational integrity is a property that is required for financial transactions on the Internet. Computational integrity means that the output of a certain computation is correct. </p><p>If I deposit money into my bank, my bank sends me a number that represents the new balance in my account. I assume that the number they have sent me is correct. The bank could be lying to me–maybe this bank is not actually trustworthy. But I use a bank with a good reputation. If the bank stole money from its users, it would quickly go out of business. Therefore, I feel safe by trusting a bank with my money, because the bank needs to maintain its reputation.</p><p>The problem with reputation-based systems is that they are opaque. It’s not easy for us to audit the bank and prove the bank actually has the money that it claims to have. Most of the time, the reputation-based systems work fine. But occasionally, we have catastrophic events–think of the 2008 financial crisis, or the Bernie Madoff financial scandal.</p><p>These circumstances would have been avoided if the financial institutions could have been continuously audited for their solvency.</p><p>With blockchains and cryptocurrencies, we now have tools that allow us to maintain computational integrity without the opaque systems of reputation. We no longer have to trust a central authority–we can verify computational integrity with math.</p><p>Eli Ben-Sasson is a co-founder and chief scientist at StarkWare Industries, a company that is bringing zero-trust technology to market. Implementations of zero-trust technology include zk-STARKs, zk-SNARKs, and bulletproofs. StarkWare is focused on the application of zk-STARKs, which can be used to improve scalability and privacy.</p><p>Eli joins the show to discuss the topic of computational integrity, and how STARKs can be used to provide scalable, secure infrastructure to blockchain applications.</p>',

You get angry tweets from anonymous Twitter accounts that are on one side of the Bitcoin scaling debate. You get to interview extreme personalities, and the technical discussions can be highly educational.</p><p>Brian Fabian Crain started the Epicenter podcast four years ago. Podcasting about cryptocurrencies allows a podcaster to report on a wide range of areas: economics, software, philosophy–and the stories within the blockchain world itself. Epicenter is one of my favorite podcasts about cryptocurrencies because Brian is always prepared enough to ask sophisticated questions. </p><p>In this episode, we talked about ICOs–when does an ICO make sense? It seems that many token economies could function just as well without a token involved. We discussed the scaling approaches of Bitcoin and Ethereum–why are these two blockchains taking very different approaches to their scaling plans? And we talked about Chorus, the company that Brian founded to build infrastructure for proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies.</p><p>I enjoyed talking to Brian about all these different subjects, and look forward to having him on again in the future.</p><p>Transcript provided by We Edit Podcasts.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Cryptocurrency security is a concern to anyone who has a significant amount of money in the form of Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other crypto assets. Most Bitcoin is held in either a Bitcoin wallet or a Bitcoin bank. </p><p>Your Bitcoin holdings are recorded on a public ledger. You access these holdings by authenticating with your private key. A Bitcoin wallet could be described more accurately as a Bitcoin keyring. Securing your Bitcoin wallet is about securing that private key. Just as there are many different ways to secure any individual piece of text, there are many ways to secure a Bitcoin private key.</p><p>A Bitcoin “bank” is a term that can be used to describe institutions such as Coinbase. Coinbase takes the technology of the Bitcoin wallet and wraps it in additional layers of security, identity, and failover that we associate with banks and large technology companies. </p><p>By using a Bitcoin bank, you sacrifice the autonomy of managing your own private key. On the bright side, you don’t have to manage your own private key. If you lose your Coinbase password, there are plenty of ways to recover it. A Bitcoin bank gives you the downsides and the upsides of working with a centralized service provider.</p><p>Jameson Lopp is a cypherpunk and cryptocurrency engineer at Casa. Casa is a company that is building long-term cryptocurrency storage and secure key infrastructure. In this episode, we explore how Bitcoin wallets work, how to secure them, the common threats, scams and hacking attempts of Bitcoin, and what he is working on at Casa.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Many elderly people live with unhealthy levels of isolation. Social isolation is a problem for anybody, but younger people can use technology to alleviate their isolation with tools like Skype and Facebook. How can we bridge the generational gap and give elderly people access to the same technological tools that younger people find easy to use?</p><p>Voice interfaces are an important new medium for communicating with computers. Amazon and Google are at the forefront of the voice interface movement, but many other devices are emerging. One of these devices is Elliq, from Intuition Robotics.</p><p>Elliq consists of a microphone voice interface that sits on a table next to a small tablet computer. An elderly person can talk to the voice interface and have it start a voice call with someone on Skype, or see new Facebook photos or YouTube videos.</p><p>The discussion of Elliq’s hardware is as interesting as that of its backend software. As Itai Mendelsohn of Intuition Robotics explains, Elliq got to market very quickly as a result of the company’s adoption of high-level managed services, like Firebase and Google’s managed machine learning.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcuVfzwB4g">ELLIQ – The active aging companion</a></p>',

Today, a deployment is often a multi-stage process. A new software build will undergo automated unit tests and integration tests, before being deployed to users.  The deployment might only go out to a small percentage of total users initially, with that percentage going up as the deployment proves not to have bugs.</p><p>Avi Cavale is the CEO of Shippable, a platform for DevOps.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>The word “DevOps” has a different definition depending on who you ask. </p><p>For some people, it is about the process of managing and releasing code. It can involve container management and server orchestration. It can involve infrastructure-as-code, and safer configuration management. In addition to a set of technologies, DevOps can be seen as a management concept that describes agile practices, and breaking down communication barriers between different teams.</p><p>One thing that most software companies have decided is that whatever DevOps is, we want it. We want to release more software, we want to do it faster, and we want to do it safer. We want streamlined communication between management and engineering. We want a full understanding of the “value chain” of software.</p><p>Despite the elusiveness of a single description for what DevOps is, GitLab can credibly describe itself as a tool that satisfies the DevOps needs of most enterprises. GitLab started as an open source version control management system based on Git. It has expanded into products that include continuous integration, security, issue tracking, and monitoring. </p><p>The trajectory of GitLab into such a large platform is something that nobody anticipated. The best explanation for how it happened is that it is the downstream result of an engineer within GitLab deciding that the code hosting product needed to have a continuous integration product bundled with it as an option for a tightly coupled, unified workflow.</p><p>Today, there are many enterprises trying to make a big set of changes to their development practices. The world is consolidating around Git for version control and Kubernetes for container management. Almost every enterprise is figuring out a “cloud strategy”. Every team wants to have continuous integration, and they want it to have some security products paired with that release workflow in a popular, vaguely defined set of practices known as “DevSecOps”.</p><p>With so many changes coming to enterprises, it turns out that many of these enterprises just want some sane defaults. When GitLab came to market with a bundled CI and code hosting product, the company discovered that the customers were very happy to have integrated tools that worked well out of the box. This was in stark contrast to the years of NxN tooling integration that an enterprise would have to make to stitch together their broad range of carefully selected tools.</p><p>Sid Sibrandij is the CEO of GitLab, and he joins the show for a conversation about how GitLab arrived at its product development strategy. In a previous episode, <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2019/03/15/gitlab-with-sid-sijbrandij/">Sid discussed some of the core features and history of GitLab.</a> Today’s show expands on many of the subjects we explored previously. We also had a spirited discussion of the modern nature of work, and how GitLab’s unique culture and fully remote team have evolved as the company has scaled.</p>',

One of his books on project management was read by Matt Mullenweg, the creator of the WordPress blogging tool that runs a large percentage of the internet (including Software Engineering Daily). Scott became friends with the WordPress founder, who is also the CEO of Automattic, a company that sells WordPress hosting and support.</p><p>Around that time, Automattic was run as a completely flat company.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Machine learning applications are widely deployed across the software industry. </p><p>Most of these applications used supervised learning, a process in which labeled data sets are used to find correlations between the labels and the trends in that underlying data. But supervised learning is only one application of machine learning. Another broad set of machine learning methods is described by the term “reinforcement learning.”</p><p>Reinforcement learning involves an agent interacting with its environment. As the model interacts with the environment, it learns to make better decisions over time based on a reward function. Newer AI applications will need to operate in increasingly dynamic environments, and react to changes in those environments, which makes reinforcement learning a useful technique.</p><p>Reinforcement learning has several attributes that make it a distinctly different engineering problem than supervised learning. Reinforcement learning relies on simulation and distributed training to rapidly examine how different model parameters could affect the performance of a model in different scenarios.</p><p>Ray is an open source project for distributed applications. Although Ray was designed with reinforcement learning in mind, the potential use cases go beyond machine learning, and could be as influential and broadly applicable as distributed systems projects like Apache Spark or Kubernetes. Ray is a project from the Berkeley RISE Lab, the same place that gave rise to Spark, Mesos, and Alluxio.</p><p>The RISE Lab is led by Ion Stoica, a professor of computer science at Berkeley. He is also the co-founder of Anyscale, a company started to commercialize Ray by offering tools and services for enterprises looking to adopt Ray. Ion Stoica returns to the show to discuss reinforcement learning, distributed computing, and the Ray project.</p><p>If you enjoy the show, you can find all of our past episodes about machine learning, data, and the RISE Lab by going to <a href="https://www.softwaredaily.com/">SoftwareDaily.com</a> and searching for the technologies or companies you are curious about .

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Investors often use the term “moat” to describe the durable competitive advantage of a company.</p><p>When an investor puts money into a company, they are making that investment based on a valuation. That valuation is subjective–it is how much the investor thinks the company is worth. A valuation is determined by the present value of future cash flows. What are the future cash flows of a company? In order to figure that out, the investor needs to know how the business will look in the future.</p><p>This is why moats are so important. If an investor looks at how much money a business made this year, it does not tell the investor very much information about how much money the business will make in the future. If the business has a durable competitive advantage, then that means that the cash flows of the company are also durable. It also means that any compounding of those cash flows will be durable growth.</p><p>It is easy to understand durability for some businesses. Why do we keep using Google? Because there is no substitute search engine that is so integrated with our daily lives. Why do we keep using Facebook? Because there is no other social networking company that has all of our friends and family.</p><p>But what about companies with substitutes? There are lots of cloud providers, log management companies, and analytics providers. These are crowded markets, and yet in each of the crowded markets there seems to be a dominant player who captures the most market share. Why is that? How do software companies in competitive markets develop a moat?</p><p>Astasia Myers is a venture investor with Redpoint, a software investment firm that makes large bets on technology companies. Astasia joins the show to discuss how software companies form competitive advantages, as well as several specific markets such as log management and cloud cost optimization.</p>',

AWS represented a huge closed ecosystem. With the amount of money at stake in the cloud business, it was only a matter of time before a more open ecosystem emerged.</p><p>Since the creation of Kubernetes, the world of cloud computing has evolved rapidly.

When Lambda first launched in 2015, it was an experimental product. Today, it is a widely used product and the market has validated the desire for serverless execution. Other cloud providers have introduced different models of serverless functionality including Google Cloud Functions, Azure Functions, and Fastly edge computing.</p><p>Zack Bloom is director of product for product strategy at Cloudflare, and he joins the show to discuss Cloudflare’s model for serverless execution.

Software workloads are isolated from each other in order to keep resource access cleanly separated. </p><p>When programs are properly isolated, it is easier for the programmer to reason about the memory safety of that program. When a program is not properly isolated, it can lead problems such as security flaws where one program can access the information that should be exclusive to a different program. Poor isolation can also lead to garbage collection problems, or running out of disk space.</p><p>Isolation takes many forms, including individual processes, containers, and virtual machines. The techniques for isolation evolve over time. A more recent technology that can assist with isolation is WebAssembly, a newer execution system that can run a variety of languages that compile down into the WebAssembly binary format.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Django is an open source web development framework that was initially released in 2005, around the same time as Ruby on Rails. In many ways, the two frameworks are similar – they expedited web development by modularizing common components of web apps and enabling developers to quickly prototype and launch their products. They both encouraged the use of the MVC architectural pattern, with each respectively acting as the controller, allowing developers to use their own front end and database technologies.</p><p>But the path of the two frameworks diverged in other parameters, including mainstream adoption. Ruby on Rails became the sweetheart in Silicon Valley and elsewhere, while Django was loved by a core constituency of pythonistas who had used Python in other applications and fallen in love with it. At the peak of the frameworks’ popularity, there was a common question from new developers asking whether they should first learn Django or Rails – the answer often boiled down to whether you wanted to use Python or Ruby. In this episode, Frank discusses the history and growth of Django, and explains how it evolved in comparison with other frameworks.</p><p>Frank Wiles is the President of the Django Software Foundation, and partner at Revolution Systems. He worked at the Lawrence Journal-World newspaper, where Django was initially conceived and created.</p>',

If I have a distributed database that I want to deploy, the complexity of that deployment is going to be different depending on whether I am running on AWS, or VMware, or my own bare metal server infrastructure. </p><p>Heterogeneous server infrastructure makes it hard to sell distributed applications that get deployed to that infrastructure. A vendor that is selling a distributed database would need to figure out how to make their database work on the infrastructure of any given customer. </p><p>Kubernetes has simplified the process of deploying a distributed application. Kubernetes is a container orchestration system that has steadily grown in popularity, to the point where the ecosystem is mature and the software is stable.

Cruise cannot put so many cars on the road, and thus has had to shift much of its testing procedures to rely more heavily on the simulations. Therefore, the simulated environments must be made very accurate, including the autonomous agents such as pedestrians and cars.</p><p>Tom Boyd is VP of Simulation at Cruise. He joins the show to talk about the testing workflow at Cruise, how the company builds simulation-based infrastructure, and his work managing simulation at the company.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Software companies such as Slack, Zoom, and Uber have recently gone public.</p><p>When a company goes public, they issue a document called an S-1. Within the S-1, there is a wealth of information about the company, providing a detailed story about the company’s business model, economics, and future prospects. The S-1 describes the operating model and the philosophy of a newly public company.</p><p>Going public serves several purposes. Being public allows a company to gain access to the public capital markets. It allows previous investors to have a liquidity event, by selling the shares that they purchased from the company in private markets. Being public also puts some constraints and visibility on a company, which can be useful for a company that is trying to develop internal discipline.</p><p>In the software industry, it is useful for most people to understand the dynamics of going public. A technology worker who is earning equity at a private company needs to understand the roadmap to their company going public, or potentially getting acquired. Anyone who invests in public technology stocks is evaluating the different available options for investment, and considering the best software companies to place a bet on.</p><p>Tom Tunguz is a venture investor at Redpoint, and the author of a popular blog at <a href="https://tomtunguz.com/">tomasztonguz.com</a>. In a recent series of posts, Tom has evaluated the S-1s and compared the growth dynamics between a variety of newer public software companies. Tom joins today’s show to discuss his writing, and offer reflections on what can be learned about company building from the recent series of IPOs and direct listings.</p>',

On today’s show, Harsh Sinha explains the peer-to-peer system of transferring money with TransferWise, where he works as VP of engineering.<br>\nHarsh also discusses the larger picture of FinTech companies. The emergence of so many companies at the intersection of finance and technology is no accident. The 2008 financial crisis created a loss of trust in the existing financial system. Simultaneously, smart phones and cheap cloud computing has created opportunities for newer companies like TransferWise to position themselves as a new option for consumer banking.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>A software company needs to get many things right in order to be successful. Having a useful product with solid engineering is only the beginning.</p><p>ReadMe was started five years ago. The company solved a seemingly simple problem: documentation for software products. If you have worked as a software engineer, you have looked at documentation. You know that there is a wide range of quality among the documentation that exists for different software products.</p><p>ReadMe solved the problem of documentation-as-a-service, and it solved the problem better than any other company in the market. But after building a great business around documentation, the direction in which to take the business was unclear. </p><p>How do you expand a documentation software business? Should you start building API management systems? Should you build lead generation tools? Should you try to sell products to developer evangelists?</p><p>Greg Koberger is the CEO of ReadMe, and he joins the show to talk about the business, the strategy, and the fundraising process for ReadMe. Greg was <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2015/10/08/rethinking-documentation-with-greg-koberger/">previously on the show</a> very early on, and he stood out as a guest that was remarkably friendly and willing to talk about a wide range of topics. In the previous show with Greg, he was one year into his business. Today, it has been five years since ReadMe was started, and we catch up on how his business has evolved since our first interview.</p><p>ReadMe had become a profitable business very early in its life. In Silicon Valley, a quickly profitable business is the exception. Rather than structuring the finances of ReadMe with the expectation of successive funding rounds every 18-24 months, Greg took a slower approach. His company grew at a rate that was affordable while maintaining that profitability.</p><p>While ReadMe maintained profitability from its core product of documentation software, Greg patiently thought about what product to build next within the company. A software company will typically expand into adjacent markets, or offer products that their current users are willing to pay additional money for. </p><p>Eventually, ReadMe found its second product: developer metrics. Greg and his team figured out that gathering metrics around how APIs are being consumed has synergies with the core ReadMe product. With a second product, ReadMe was now able to forecast significant growth. The company also gained an incentive to raise money. </p><p>With additional money, ReadMe would be able to deepen the developer metrics product, hire a bigger team, and think much bigger than they would have been able to as a single-product company with a smaller total addressable market. ReadMe raised a series A from Accel, one of the most respected venture capital firms in the business, and the company is now entering a new period in its development.</p><p>ReadMe is a fascinating case study in balancing ambition with financial discipline at a software company.</p>',

As V8 is observing your code and analyzing it, V8 needs to allocate resources in order to determine what code to optimize. This process can be quite memory intensive, and can add significant overhead to the memory overhead of Chrome.</p><p>Ross McIlroy is an engineer at Google, where he worked on a project called V8 Lite.

In this episode, Emil argues that the academic study of emergency management and industries such as aerospace and transportation have a lot to teach software engineers about responding to production problems.  </p><p>In this interview with guest host Adam Bell, Emil argues that we need to move beyond tribal knowledge and incorporate practices such as an incident command system and rigorous use of checklists. Emil suggests that we need to move beyond a mindset of “move fast and break things” and toward a place of more deliberate preparation.</p><p>Transcript provided by We Edit Podcasts.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>I like to write music, and a year ago I started working on an album called “Gig Economy”. The plan for the album was to hire musicians from gig economy platforms like Fiverr and Upwork to perform on songs that I produced.<br></p><p>The album is finished and I’m happy with the result, so I’m sharing it on the podcast today as an extra episode released on a Sunday. We’ll be back tomorrow with content about software engineering.<br></p><p>Writing this album made me think about the future of work. I love music, but I am not a professional musician. I take the craft seriously, but perhaps not as seriously as someone who has made music their full-time career. I’ve never taken the time to network with musicians and develop collaborative relationships.<br></p><p>The gig economy allowed me to pay creative people to collaborate with me. The transactional nature of my relationship with the collaborators meant that both of us had the incentive structure to work effectively. This improved quality and kept the pace of the project moving quickly.<br></p><p>Today, the gig economy is widely regarded as a mode of work that removes individuality. Critics of the gig economy say that it turns workers into a commodity. If you use Uber, you aren’t thinking about the human who is driving you. As long as your driver has a high rating, you are satisfied.<br></p><p>My experience producing this album with gig economy musicians showed a different side of our new employment systems.<br></p><p>I found artists who I deeply enjoyed working with. There was no ambiguity about our relationship. Nobody was flaky. I paid these collaborators well, and in return they helped me fulfill an artistic vision. <br></p><p>Without gig economy platforms, I could not have written this album.<br></p><p>The gig economy is a playground for creativity. If you want to get paid to work as an artist, you can do so as long as you have a laptop. If you are a corporate worker making a good salary, but you spend your weekend producing art, you can pay artists to help you complete your vision.<br></p><p>The greatest works of art are often the result of a talented workforce directed by an established leader. The gig economy lets you become a leader and recruit a team of creative, proven artists in a single day.<br></p><p>I hope you enjoy “Gig Economy”. If you would rather listen on Spotify or YouTube, links are below.<br></p><p>If you like the album, please share it on Twitter or Facebook. If you listened all the way through and have feedback for me, I’d love to know your thoughts. You can send me a tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/the_prion">@the_prion</a> or an email: jeff@softwareengineeringdaily.com<br></p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Computational load is the amount of demand that is being placed on a computer system. “Load” can take the form of memory, CPU, network bandwidth, disk space, and other finite resources. </p><p>When we design systems, we need to prepare for high-load events. On a social network, people are much more active in the mornings. On an e-commerce site, Black Friday causes many more users to come online for discount shopping. Our distributed application must be able to scale in response to these spikes in traffic.</p><p>Cloud computing has changed the popular software architecture patterns, and load balancing has changed along with it. With on-demand, infinite infrastructure, we don’t need to worry about ordering servers and provisioning. With infrastructure as code, it becomes simpler to manage lots of deployable units–so we can break up our monolith into microservices, and have hundreds or thousands of virtual machines or containers running.</p><p>Enterprises that were started before cloud computing have large on-premise server deployments–but today, many of them also use the cloud. The cloud can be used to augment their classic on-prem deployments with cloud platform-as-a-service features. The cloud can also be used as a reliable way to scale during high load events.</p><p>Today, a common architectural pattern is to have your application broken up into services. Each of those services has multiple instances. When the load on a particular service is under lots of demand, you create more instances to handle the increased load. How do you monitor the load on each service? How do you know when to spin up new instances of the service?</p><p>Load analysis and load balancing across different services can be implemented by placing “agents” throughout your infrastructure. These agents gather data about services and service instances, and route that data to a centralized place. The centralized “control plane” can be used to make decisions about load-balancing and traffic routing.</p><p>Ranga Rajagopalan worked on networking at Cisco for a decade before co-founding Avi Networks as CTO. Avi Networks builds modern load balancing software, and in today’s episode, Ranga describes the requirements of load balancing. We talked about the evolution of network infrastructure, the impact of the cloud, and the technical decisions that his team has made when architecting Avi Networks.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>In the first 10 years of cloud computing, a set of technologies emerge that every software enterprise needs; continuous delivery, version control, logging, monitoring, routing, data warehousing. These tools were built into the Cloud Foundry project, a platform for application deployment and management.</p><p>As we enter the second decade of cloud computing, another new set of technologies are emerging as useful tools. Serverless functions allow for rapid scalability at a low cost. Kubernetes offers a control plane for containerized infrastructure. Reactive programming models and event sourcing make an application more responsive and simplify the interactions between teams who are sharing data sources.</p><p>The job of a cloud provider is to see new patterns in software development and offer tools to developers to help them implement those new patterns. Of course, building these tools is a huge investment. If you’re a cloud provider, your customers are trusting you with the health of their application. The tool that you build has to work properly and you have to help the customers figure out how to leverage the tool and resolve any breakages.</p><p>Onsi Fakhouri is the senior VP of R&amp;D for cloud at Pivotal, a company that provides a software and support for Spring, Cloud Foundry and several other tools. I sat down with Onsi to discuss his strategy for determining which products Pivotal chooses to build. There are a multitude of engineering and business elements that Onsi has to consider when allocating resources to a project.</p><p>Cloud Foundry is used by giant corporations like banks, telcos and automotive manufacturers. Spring is used by most enterprises that run Java, including most of the startups that I have worked at in the past. Cloud Foundry has to be able to run on premise and in the cloud providers like AWS, Google and Microsoft. Pivotal also has its own cloud, Pivotal Web Services, and all of these stakeholders have different technologies that they would like to see built. Onsi’s job is to determine which ones have the highest net impact and make a decision on those and allocate resources towards them.</p><p>I interviewed Onsi at Spring One Platform, which is a conference that is organized by Pivotal who, full disclosure, is a sponsor of Software Engineering Daily. This week’s episodes are all conversations from that conference, and if there’s a conference that you think I should attend and do coverage at, let me know. Whether you like this format or not, I would love to get your feedback. We have some big developments coming for Software Engineering Daily in 2018 and we want to have a closer dialogue with the listeners.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Biology research is complex. The sample size of a biological data set is often too small to make confident judgments about the biological system being studied. </p><p>During Jason Knight’s PhD research, the RNA sequence data that he was studying was not significant enough to make strong conclusions about the gene regulatory networks he was trying to understand.</p><p>After working in academia, and then at Human Longevity, Inc Jason came to the conclusion that the best way to work towards biology breakthroughs was to work on the computer systems that enable those breakthroughs. He went to work at Nervana Systems on hardware and software for deep learning. Nervana was subsequently acquired by Intel. In this episode, we discuss how machine learning can be applied to biology today, and how industrial research and development is key to enabling more breakthroughs in the future.</p><p>The main lesson I took away from this show is that while we have seen phenomenal breakthroughs in certain areas of health–like image recognition applied to diabetic retinopathy or skin cancer–the challenges of reverse engineering our genome to understand how nucleic acids fit together into humans are still out of reach, and improving the hardware used for deep learning will be necessary to tackle these kinds of informational challenges.</p>',

Why wouldn’t you? It’s no different than hopping on an open wifi network at an airport, or a Starbucks, or your friend’s house, right?</p><p>One major difference: the hardware is easily accessible to previous guests at the short-term rental. Previous guests could tamper with the software on a router, and use that tampering to do some malicious, surveillant things.</p><p>Jeremy Galloway is a security engineer at Atlassian. In today’s show, he explains the risk of using wifi at a short-term rental like an Airbnb–including an explanation of how easy it is to take over a wifi network as a guest at a rental property. </p><p>A broader point we discuss: large attack surfaces are difficult to secure. Whether we are talking about Airbnb, or another sharing economy app like Uber, or a large corporate network like Atlassian, or even your own personal life.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Self-driving, electric cars will someday outnumber traditional automobiles on the road. As transportation becomes autonomous, it is hard to imagine an industry that will not be affected by the downstream effects of this change.</p><p>These cars will likely be managed by fleet operators like Lyft and Uber. We will need fewer cars, and the amount of space dedicated to those cars will shrink dramatically. Parking lots, massive roads, and gas stations will be reclaimed or repurposed. City planning departments will have to devise entirely new strategies.</p><p>As the self-driving cars reach consumer availability, an intricate supply chain for these cars will develop. When smartphones became mass-produced, the costs of GPS devices, accelerometers, and other small components dropped steeply. A consequence of the smartphone supply chain was that other devices like consumer drones became affordable. The self-driving car supply chain will lead to the mass production of building blocks for other new devices.</p><p>With fewer automotive fatalities, the economics of the car insurance industry might collapse completely. At a minimum, the costs of car insurance will likely shift to the fleet operators, who can purchase that car insurance at prices factoring in their large risk pool.</p><p>Frank Chen is a deal and research partner with Andreessen Horowitz. In a series of presentations on the <a href="https://a16z.com/2018/02/03/autonomy-ecosystem-frank-chen-summit/">Autonomy Ecosystem</a>, Frank explores the effects of our impending shift to self-driving electric cars.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Are we a media company or a technology company? Facebook and the <em>New York Times</em> are both asking themselves this question. </p><p>Facebook originally intended to focus only on building technology–to be a neutral arbiter of information. This has turned out to be impossible. The Facebook newsfeed is defined by algorithms that are only as neutral as the input data. Even if we could agree on a neutral data set to build a neutral newsfeed, the algorithms that generate this news feed are not public, so we have no way to vet their neutrality.</p><p>Facebook is such a powerful engine for distribution, it has allowed for a rise in the number of publishers who can get their voice heard. As a result, large media companies have lost market share because Facebook has replaced their distribution.</p><p><em>The New York Times</em> has always been a media company–but the standards for media consumption have shot up. Millions of people produce content for free, and that content is distributed through high quality experiences like Twitter, YouTube, Medium, and Facebook. When a page takes too long to load on NewYorkTimes.com, it doesn’t matter how good the content is–the user is going to navigate away before they read anything.</p><p>Today, the <em>New York Times</em> has built out an experienced engineering team. In a previous episode, we reported <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2017/10/30/kafka-at-ny-times-with-boerge-svingen/">how the Times uses Kafka</a> to make its old content more accessible.  In today’s show, we talk about how the Times uses React and GraphQL to improve the performance and the developer experience of engineers who are building software at the <em>New York Times</em>. </p><p>Scott Taylor and James Lawrie are software engineers at the <em>New York Times</em>. In this episode, they explain how the <em>New York Times</em> looks at technology. The user experience on <em>New York Times</em> rivals that of a platform company like Facebook, and this is assisted by technologies originally built at Facebook: React, Relay, and GraphQL.</p><p>Transcript provided by We Edit Podcasts.

Your urbit presents your whole digital life as a single web service.</p><p>Urbit feels foreign and confusing for those of us coming from the traditional web because the normal paradigm is to iterate and paper over the problems of the current platform with new things built on top. Curtis Yarvin, the creator of Urbit, argues that the current model is too fundamentally broken for that to work. As he says: “the Internet as a client-server network has won. The Internet as a peer-to-peer network has failed.”</p><p>This sounds like yet another quirky, overambitious developer side project–but Urbit has serious legs. The github repo has had 51 committers over its four years of activity. Last year, a public crowdsale of Urbit address space raised more than $200,000. Peter Thiel was an early investor in the project, perhaps partly due to the combination of persistence, technical skill, and unusual opinions of Curtis Yarvin.</p><p>In this episode, Curtis and Galen Wolfe-Pauly join me for a conversation about Urbit–its strange computing platform and the contrarian philosophies that drive its creators.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Blogging is more than 20 years old. Over that period of time, numerous publishing platforms have been created. Squarespace, Blogger, Medium, and Twitter are popular closed source platforms. WordPress has been the most popular open source blogging platform–and much of the Internet (including Software Engineering Daily) runs on WordPress.</p><p>WordPress is a powerful platform. News companies, ecommerce websites, and many other kinds of businesses use WordPress as their central publishing tool. But WordPress has been around for 15 years–and there are some potential conflicts of interest between WordPress the open source project and WordPress.com (a company started to host WordPress websites).</p><p>John O’Nolan was working as a WordPress developer when he decided to start a new publishing platform called Ghost. Five years later, the Ghost project is a success–with a thriving open source community, a profitable SaaS business, and companies like Digital Ocean and Mozilla using Ghost to host their blogs.</p><p>John and I discussed his background with WordPress, what he wanted to do differently with Ghost, and the software architecture of Ghost. We also touched on the Ghost SaaS business and the management of the open source project.</p>',

In this episode Pranay Mohan and Erika Hokanson join me for a reflection on where we have been and where we are going. Pranay was the producer of Software Engineering Daily for the first year, after which he left and went to work at Snapchat. Erika joined the show 9 months ago to work on operations, ad sales, and expansion plans.</p><p>The thesis of Software Engineering Daily has always been that serious, in-depth material about software provides value. Right now we are a podcast about software engineering. We are planning expansion into a larger media company with video, a mobile app, a desktop platform, more podcasts, and more journalism. Pranay, Erika, and I have crafted the vision for Software Engineering Daily. </p><p>We want serious, inspiring, technical content to be more widespread. We know that you do too.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>An engineer who wants to start a business using investment capital needs to understand the expectations of investors. The market for the business needs to be huge. The team needs to have a differentiated understanding of the market, or a differentiated product. The CEO needs to have the determination to continue operating the company even when it gets very difficult. And the price needs to be right for the investor.</p><p>Even if you are just working at a startup, or considering joining a startup, you must understand how the investment market works. From a raw financial standpoint, it only makes sense to spend your time at a startup that has equity with a high expected value. Your equity will only have high expected value if the company continues to exist long enough to have an exit–the company must either go public or get acquired.</p><p>In order to make it down the long and winding road to an exit, a technology company often needs to raise money on multiple occasions. That money is used to pay employees like you! If the company can’t earn enough revenues or raise money, you are going to get fired. Then, you may not have the spare cash to execute your stock options, and you might lose the rights to the equity that you worked so hard for.</p><p>The best way to avoid this is to learn to think like an investor–because as an engineer working for equity, you are an investor.</p><p>Semil Shah is an early stage seed investor with Haystack, a fund that he started. He also works with GGV Capital, a venture firm investing out of the United States and China. Semil has been blogging about technology for many years, and eventually evolved from a commentator to an investor. In this episode, we explore the dynamics between investors and founders of early-stage technology companies. We also explore the strange market of podcasting. Semil worked at a company called Concept.io, which was acquired by Apple for $30M.</p><p>We have done some great shows with other engineering investors like Chris Dixon and Adrian Colyer.

Go includes abstractions that simplify aspects of low level engineering that are historically difficult—concurrency, resource allocation, and dependency management. In that light, it makes sense that the Kubernetes container orchestration system was written in Go.</p><p>Erik St. Martin is a cloud developer advocate at Microsoft, where he focuses on Go and Kubernetes. He also hosts the podcast “Go Time,” and has written a book on Go called <em>Go In Action</em>.</p><p>Recently, Erik helped build the virtual Kubelet project, which allows Kubernetes nodes to be backed by services outside of that cluster. If you want your Kubernetes cluster to leverage abstractions such as serverless functions and standalone container instances, you can use Virtual Kubelet to treat these other abstractions as nodes.</p><p>Erik also discussed his experience using Kubernetes at Comcast—which was a great case study. Near the end of the show, he also talked about organizing Gophercon, a popular conference for Go programmers—if you are organizing a conference or thinking about organizing one, it will be useful information to you.

In a cloud infrastructure deployment, a user might have the rights to deploy a new server. One microservice may or may not have the necessary permissions to talk to another microservice. All of these are use cases where a “policy” defines the behavior within a computer system.</p><p>Policies in a company can be managed in a range of ways: configuration files, dashboards, and centralized permissions databases. A policy engine is a system for managing and automating the policy creation and deployment within an organization.</p><p>Microservices need to verify each request that comes in to ensure that the request has the correct permissions. To check those permissions, a microservice can contact the policy engine. The policy engine has all the information from the whole organization about who is allowed to do what. However, talking to the policy engine over the network can be a slow process.</p><p>Open Policy Agent is a deployable agent that can run as a sidecar next to a service, and check policies by looking inside of a cache.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Decentralized applications can be built on the Ethereum blockchain. Just as the Bitcoin blockchain is a distributed, append-only ledger of financial transaction history, Ethereum is a distributed, append-only ledger of computational transaction history. </p><p>New kinds of applications can be built on the Ethereum blockchain—and just like every new technology, we need an interface to bridge that new technology and our existing technology.  We can use a pure Ethereum browser like Mist—or we can use a Chrome extension like Metamask to turn our normal browser into an Ethereum interface.</p><p>Dan Finlay is the lead developer of Metamask. In today’s episode, we explore why you would want to interface with decentralized applications, and the different ways of doing so. A few examples we explore—simple transactions like transferring Ether from one person to another; or transacting with a smart contract. </p><p>My personal anecdote: I recently used Metamask for the first time to fund a GitCoin issue. GitCoin is a way to put up financial rewards for people solving open source issues. I locked up $42 in an Ethereum smart contract, and it became the bounty of that issue. The issue was solved, and I released the $42 from the smart contract to be sent to the developer who solved it. In this example, Ethereum served as a simple escrow service. To send my Ether, I used the Metamask plugin on my Chrome browser. If you are a little confused—don’t worry. We explain it all in this episode.</p><p>Transcript provided by We Edit Podcasts.

Soumya is advised by Emin Gun Sirer, a Cornell professor who previously appeared <a href="https://www.softwaredaily.com/post/59eb13b109be4b711254d384/Smart-Contract-Security-with-Emin-Gn-Sirer">on the show to discuss smart contract security.</a></p><p>Soumya joins the show today to talk about a variety of issues in the cryptocurrency space. We first explored the degree to which Bitcoin and Ethereum are actually decentralized–which might be less than you think. Because of the centralization of mining pools, much of the transaction processing is also centralized. After talking about decentralization, we got into Soumya’s research focus–cryptocurrency networking and block propagation.</p><p>Bitcoin transactions are collected into blocks. When a Bitcoin full node solves the cryptographic puzzle associated with a block of transactions, that full node broadcasts the new block to all the other nodes in the network. It is important for that block broadcast to be fast and efficient, so that the other full nodes in the network can be made aware of the new block as soon as possible, and they can start working from the updated chain.</p><p>The problem of making all nodes in the network aware of a new block is known as “block propagation.” Block propagation can be accelerated through the use of relay nodes. A relay node is a node that is dedicated to communicating these new blocks throughout the blockchain. Soumya is working on a relay node architecture called Falcon–and in this episode we talk all about what Falcon is.</p><p>If you are looking for all 700 episodes of Software Engineering Daily, check out our apps on the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/software-engineering-daily/id1253734426?mt=8">iOS</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.koalatea.thehollidayinn.softwareengineeringdaily&amp;hl=en">Android</a> app store.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Apple controls the iOS ecosystem. As an accident of history, Apple also controls the podcasting ecosystem. Unlike most ecosystems within Apple’s dominion, podcasts remain open. A podcaster merely has to record an mp3, distribute it via RSS feed, and submit that RSS feed to the iTunes podcast portal.</p><p>Podcasting has thrived in recent years, but very few technology companies have managed to take advantage of that growth. Libsyn is the most popular place to host a podcast. Libsyn is a combination of a CDN, a hosting service, analytics, and place to get an RSS feed for a podcaster. There have been many clones of Libsyn over the years, but the company remains the industry standard.</p><p>For people who are confused–iTunes does not host any audio files. It is just an index of feeds. A podcaster needs to host audio files somewhere in order to give iTunes access.</p><p>Today’s guest Rob Walch joins the show to talk about podcasts–including his podcast Today in iOS. I had a great time meeting Rob at the Microsoft Build conference. Special thanks to Bharat Bhat for organizing the podcast booths at Microsoft Build.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>When a new employee joins a software company, it is often unclear where that employee should begin. Do they have a mentor? What are they working on? What are the expectations for how fast that employee should be contributing?</p><p>The early period of employment is often referred to as “onboarding.” During the onboarding period, an employee will learn the basics of the company they have just joined. These basics include the work procedures, meeting schedules, expectations, and technical tools that an employee needs to become productive.</p><p>A poor onboarding process can slow an employee down, and even cause them to quit the company entirely. Conversely, a good onboarding process can accelerate an employee towards rapid contribution within the organization. A scalable onboarding process can be a difference in millions of dollars in productivity per year across the organization.</p><p>Kristen Gallagher is the founder of Edify, a company that helps organizations define and implement their onboarding process.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Cloud computing was popularized in 2006 with the launch of Amazon Web Services. AWS allowed developers to use remote server infrastructure with a simple set of APIs. But even with AWS, it was still not simple to deploy and manage a web application.</p><p>In 2007, Heroku launched a platform built on top of AWS. Heroku focused on the developer experience by optimizing for users who were deploying Ruby on Rails applications. Since then, Heroku has expanded into other forms of managed infrastructure, including other application frameworks like NodeJS, and databases like Postgres.</p><p>Heroku was the first popular “layer 2” cloud provider. Twelve years later, it is probably still the most popular. But there have been many other cloud providers built on top of AWS, including Netlify, Zeit, Spotinst, and Firebase.</p><p>Layer 1 cloud providers are Google Cloud, AWS, Azure, Digital Ocean, and other raw infrastructure providers. These companies provide a great service in their low cost, commodity infrastructure. But the layer 1 providers are not optimizing for developer experience. They need to cater to a broad set of developers, some of whom want to work at a low level.</p><p>A layer 2 cloud provider can build an opinionated solution that serves a subset of the overall cloud market particularly well.</p><p>Render is a layer 2 cloud provider that optimizes for specific developer workflows, such as deploying a NodeJS web server, a static site, or a Docker container. Anurag Goel is the founder of Render, and he joins the show to discuss the strategy and the economics of Render. Anurag was also one of the early employees at Stripe, and he discusses his experience and learnings from working at the company.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Remember when the best game you could play on your phone was Snake?</p><p>In 1998, Snake was preloaded on Nokia phones, and it was massively popular. That same year Half-Life won game of the year on PC. Metal Gear Solid came out for Playstation. The first version of Starcraft also came out in 1998.</p><p>In 1998, few people would have anticipated that games with as much interactivity as Starcraft would be played on mobile phones twenty years later. Today, mobile phones have the graphics and processing power of a desktop gaming PC from two decades ago. </p><p>But one thing still separates desktop gaming from mobile gaming: the network.</p><p>With desktop gaming, users have a reliable wired connection that keeps their packets moving over the network with speeds that let them compete with other users. With mobile gaming, the network can be flaky. How do we architect real-time strategy games that can be played over an intermittent network connection?</p><p>Yan Cui is an engineer at Space Ape Games, a company that makes interactive multiplayer games for mobile devices. In a previous episode, Yan described his work re-architecting a social networking startup where the costs had gotten out of control.  Yan has a skill for describing software architecture and explaining the tradeoffs.</p><p>When architecting a multiplayer mobile game, there are many tradeoffs to consider. What do you build and what do you buy? Do you centralize your geographical deployment to make it easier to reconcile conflicts, or do you spread your server deployment out globally? What is the interaction between the mobile clients and the server? </p><p>The question of interaction between client and server for a mobile game has lessons that are important for anyone building a highly interactive mobile application. </p><p>For example, think about Uber. When I make a request for a car, I can look at my phone and see the car on the map, slowly approaching me. The driver can look at his phone and see if I move across the street. </p><p>This is accomplished by synchronizing the data from the driver’s phone and my phone in a centralized server, and sending the synchronized state of the world out to me and the driver. How much data does the centralized server need to get from the mobile phones? How often does it need to make those requests?</p><p>The answers to these questions will vary based on bandwidth, device type, phone battery life, and other factors.</p><p>There are similar problems in mobile game engineering, when users are in different players on a virtual map. They are fighting each other, trying to avoid enemies, trying to steal power ups from each other. Mobile games can be even more interactive than a ridesharing app like Uber, so the questions of data synchronization can be even harder to answer.</p><p>On Software Engineering Daily, we have explored the topic of real-time synchronization in our past shows about the infrastructure of Uber and Lyft.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>The browser has become the central application of the consumer operating system. Every piece of client software, from email to document management, has become usable through the browser. Even modern desktop software such as Slack is built using Electron, a tool for building client applications that essentially run inside of a browser without an address bar.</p><p>One activity that still takes place largely outside of the browser is the process of writing and deploying code. A developer often uses an IDE such as Eclipse to write their code, then switches over to a terminal where they can build and deploy their code to a remote server running in the cloud.</p><p>For a developer who has been writing code for a long time, this process feels completely intuitive. But for a new developer, it can be totally disorienting. New developers sometimes have trouble understanding the difference between a local and remote environment, or how to use repository management software like Git. This is in addition to all the other problems a new developer might be dealing with, such as language installation, syntax, and package management.</p><p>Repl.it is a browser-based coding environment, compute engine, and collaborative workspace. Repl.it has found significant traction among new programmers who begin their programming journey within Repl.it and then stay in the environment, even as their applications become more richly featured and complicated.</p><p>Repl.it is an amazing piece of software, and the story behind it is remarkable. Amjad Masad had the idea for Repl.it many years before he started the company for it, but he needed to first build up the money and confidence in order to go after the business with full force. Amjad joins the show to talk about his long journey towards building Repl.it, and to discuss the thriving Repl.it platform in its current form.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>A data warehouse provides fast access to large data sets for analytics, data science, and dashboards. A data warehouse differs from a transactional database, because you often do not need to update specific records. Because of the read-only nature of the access patterns, and the high volumes of data being queried, the design of a data warehouse is very different than a transactional database.</p><p>With a transactional database (such as MySQL or MongoDB), it is important to have consistency guarantees. For example, consider a transactional database that serves as the backend for banking applications. If multiple frontend servers are hitting that transactional database to withdraw money, you need the records to be quickly updated. You need to avoid race conditions, so that two servers cannot withdraw the entire bank account balance simultaneously from different locations.</p><p>In contrast to transactional databases, a data warehouse is often used to process a query that encompasses a big data set. For example, Netflix might want to answer the question: “how many users that watched House of Cards also watched Black Mirror?” Netflix has a lot of users, so they will want to be accessing those user records in a way that lets them scan through the records quickly.</p><p>Christian Kleinerman is the VP of product at Snowflake Computing. Snowflake’s main product is a cloud data warehouse. In today’s show, we talk about the difference between a data warehouse, a data lake, and a transactional database, and the process of moving data sets between them, often known as ETL.</p><p>This show continues our series on <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/?s=data+platform">data engineering and data platforms</a>. As companies accumulate more and more data, the complexity of managing that data and taking full advantage of it is escalating. Christian gives his perspective on these changing trends, and describes the plans for Snowflake to evolve as a business.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Serverless architecture is software that runs without an addressable server. Serverless is made possible by two types of technology: platform as a service providers like Auth0, and functions as a service like AWS Lambda.</p><p>With both of these technologies, we can program logic that runs without being deployed to a server. </p><p>Functions as a service are cheap and scalable. Write your code for a Serverless function, and the cloud provider will cheaply deploy and execute that function on some server somewhere. The difficult part is maintaining state. </p><p>Since Serverless compute instances are ephemeral, you aren’t dealing with a system that will keep track of your state—it is going to disappear eventually.</p><p>The ephemeral nature of Serverless code requires us to shift our thinking—but the dramatic cost and simplified scalability make it well worth the effort.</p><p>Serverless functions can add complexity in exchange for lower price. Serverless “platform as a service” often lowers complexity at a slightly higher price.</p><p>A Serverless database like Firebase handles database scaling and gives you a nice web interface. A Serverless machine learning platform like Google CloudML gives your models scalability and controlled deployment. A Serverless authentication service like Auth0 manages your authentication.</p><p>In addition to authentication, Auth0 has built a set of tools to allow SaaS companies to extend their platforms into a sandboxed code execution environment. Bobby Johnson is an engineer at Auth0, and he joins the show to describe the toolbox that Auth0 has developed: authentication, webtasks, and extensibility–and how the world of “serverless” architecture is evolving.

It was built by Abhishek Singh as part of his thesis. Abhishek wanted to explore the border between inanimate electronics and the electronics we personify. Peeqo is a cylindrical tube that bends slightly, like the human neck. At its head, it has a smartphone-sized screen that displays gifs to reflect its feedback visually.</p><p>Abhishek also has a company called <a href="http://www.svrround.com">Svrround</a>, which makes 360 degree video experiences. We explore the changes to engineering that allow someone to be involved in two cutting-edge projects at once despite having very few employees working with him.</p><p>This was an energizing conversation, and I greatly enjoyed meeting Abhishek.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Kafka is at the center of modern streaming systems. Kafka serves as a database, a pubsub system, a buffer, and a data recovery tool. It’s an extremely flexible tool, and that flexibility has led to its use as a platform for a wide variety of data intensive applications.</p><p>Today’s guest is Gwen Shapira, a product manager at Confluent. Confluent is a company that was started by the creators of Apache Kafka–Jay Kreps, Neha Narkhede, and Jun Rao, who have all been on the show in previous episodes. In those shows, we discussed the inner workings of Kafka. This episode is more about practical use cases and design patterns.</p><p>Gwen explores a few use cases. First, reconciling data between different servers. A massive, international, multi-user game like World of Warcraft needs to keep its users in sync despite the fact that those users are pinging different server locations. Kafka can help reconcile data between the multiple servers. This discussion reminded me of the <a href="https://www.softwaredaily.com/#/post/5a2e5b24bc9ac50004477f12/Scalable-Multiplayer-Games-with-Yan-Cui">awesome show we did with Yan Cui</a> about scalable multiplayer games.</p><p>Other examples we discussed include log management, data enrichment, and large scale analytics. It was a great conversation and I think you will enjoy it as well.</p><p>Summer internship applications to Software Engineering Daily are also being accepted.

Roughly 40% of all e-commerce sales in Sweden go through Klarna. </p><p>Klarna’s original differentiator was that it allowed users to checkout of e-commerce stores without entering in credit card information. Instead, the user enters an email address and registers with Klarna. This allows Klarna to assume the risk of the transaction, in place of the credit card company.</p><p>Klarna’s clever payment method became very popular, and 13 years later Klarna is a bank with a variety of financial services and payment methods. Marcus Granstrom is a director of engineering at Klarna. His work ranges from product development to systems architecture to management. His cross functional role has some similarity to Raylene Yung from Stripe, who is also an engineering director at a payments company, and was on the show yesterday.</p><p>Marcus walked me through the life of a payment hitting Klarna’s servers, and this served as a nice starting point for a conversation about Klarna’s infrastructure, their product, and their engineering practices.</p>',

Operating systems need to be updated and security vulnerabilities need to be patched. Servers fail, and their workloads need to be automatically scheduled onto other servers to avoid downtime.</p><p>In contrast to classic on-prem data center management, the cloud provides many benefits: automatic updates, an infinite pool of resources, fully programmable infrastructure as code. In the cloud, developers can provision infrastructure with an API request. Continuous delivery pipelines can be spun up at the click of a button.</p><p>This tooling makes it dramatically easier for developers to move quickly, and for a business to move faster. Companies that operate their own data center want to be able to have these benefits of the cloud while still controlling their own infrastructure.</p><p>Today’s guest Bob Fraser works at HPE on OneView, a tool for managing on-prem infrastructure like a cloud.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>In the tech industry, we have all grown to fear “lock-in.” Lock-in is a situation in which you have no choice but to pay a certain provider for some aspect of your computer services. Since computers are so fundamental to our lives, we sometimes have no choice but to pay the provider of that lock-in service.</p><p>Think of a few service providers in your life who have no serious competition. What is your relationship to that service provider? Do you feel like you are paying too much money? Do you wish that you could switch?</p><p>This is how many people feel about their Internet service provider. An Internet Service Provider is the company that provides you with the “last mile” of physical infrastructure that connects you to the rest of the Internet. Different forms of ISP include cable ISPs, satellite ISPs, fiber ISPs, and copper/DSL ISPs. The medium of delivery varies, but the functionality is the same. This company is crucial to your Internet access.</p><p>In many geographic locations, there are very restricted options for which ISP you could use. Why is that? Many people assume that there is some physical or regulatory barrier to starting an ISP. In fact, there are fewer barriers than you might think.</p><p>Adam Montgomery is a co-founder of Necto, a company that provides an ISP starter kit. If you want to start your own ISP in an apartment building or in your neighborhood or wherever you are, the Necto ISP starter kit can help you get off the ground. That might sound like a crazy idea, but in this episode Adam explains why it is not so crazy–why the technology around ISPs is more broadly accessible than many people believe.</p><p>Transcript provided by We Edit Podcasts.

Continuous integration is the process of automatically building and deploying code that gets pushed to a remote repository. Continuous deployment is the process of moving that code through a pipeline of environments, from dev to test to production. At each stage, the engineers feel increasingly safe that the code will not break the user experience.</p><p>When a company adopts Kubernetes, the workflow for deploying software within that company might need to be refactored. If the company starts to deploy containers in production, and managing those containers using Kubernetes, the company will also want to have a testing pipeline that emulates the production environment using containers and Kubernetes.</p><p>Sheroy Marker is the head of technology at ThoughtWorks products, where he works on GoCD, a continuous delivery tool. Sheroy joins the show to talk about how Kubernetes affects continuous delivery workflows, and the process of building out Kubernetes integrations for GoCD. </p><p>We also discussed the landscape of continuous delivery tools–why there are so many continuous delivery tools, and the question of how to choose a continuous delivery product if you are implementing CD. Continuous delivery tooling is in some ways like the space of monitoring, logging, and analytics–there are lots of successful products in the market.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>When I buy a mattress online, I pay for it with my credit card. Behind the scenes, a complex series of transactions occur between a payment gateway, the credit card company, and a few banks. There are problems with this process–it is slow, complex, and involves the synchronization of several different parties. </p><p>Some consumers will not want to purchase the mattress because they do not have cash, and the lending rates they get offered are higher than they are willing to spend. If these consumers were presented with more intelligent loan rates, the lender could still make money, the mattress company could still make money, and the consumer would get a new mattress. It’s a missed opportunity all around.</p><p>Affirm is a consumer financial services company. Their first product offers loans to consumers making purchases. In today’s episode, Affirm CTO Libor Michalek explains how Affirm decided to build this product, and what they have done to scale it. </p><p>The conversation took me by surprise. Affirm was started by Max Levchin, who was a co-founder of PayPal. I assumed that when Affirm was created, they already knew exactly what they were going to build–because Affirm is a payments company and Max has had knowledge of the payments industry going back two decades. In reality, Affirm started out with more vague ideas around what they were building. </p><p>They spent some time running small experiments as they looked for product/market fit–just like a bootstrapped startup would have. It was inspiring to know that even an experienced team is willing to go through the humble process of searching for a product within a space they are deeply familiar with.</p><p>We didn’t get to all the questions I was planning to explore, but I hope to do another show about Affirm in the future.</p><p>Transcript provided by We Edit Podcasts.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Podcast listeners usually find out about a new podcast in one of two ways: either a friend recommends that podcast or the Apple podcast charts rank that new podcast highly. </p><p>The Apple podcast charts are created using an algorithm that is not public. Many people believe that the chart ranking of a podcast is based on the number of podcast subscribers, the number of podcast downloads, and the reviews that are written about the podcasts on iTunes.</p><p>Jack Rhysider is <a href="https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/27/">the host of Darknet Diaries</a>, a podcast about the dark and strange elements of the Internet. Darknet Diaries is told in a high quality, narrative audio format. Jack is a security engineer with a deep understanding of technology, and has been blogging for a long time.</p><p>As Jack has built a following with his podcast, he has spent more time looking at the iTunes podcast charts. He has seen the rank of Darknet Diaries increase–but he has seen the rank of other podcasts increase much faster. Some of these podcasts have low quality content. The audio quality is poor, the host is unprepared–these are the kinds of podcasts you would listen to once, and never subscribe to.</p><p>And yet, numerous podcasts with low quality were somehow able to game the rankings and make it to the top of the charts.</p><p>In <a href="https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/27/">episode 27 of Darknet Diaries</a>, Jack investigated the phenomenon of fraudulent podcast chart manipulation. It was one of my favorite podcast episodes ever (and this is coming from someone who has listened to a lot of podcasts). The investigation went to several unexpected places, but Jack did solve the riddle of how low quality podcasts climb the iTunes charts.</p><p>Jack joins the show to talk about fraudulent–and the broader implications of the fake Internet. Today’s episode is a simple example of how easily Internet platforms can be gamed–for a deeper dive into the fake Internet, <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/?s=ad+fraud">listen to our past episodes on advertising fraud</a>, or tomorrow’s episode with ad fraud investigative journalist Craig Silverman, which I am very excited about.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Bitcoin is an immutable, append-only blockchain ledger that reaches consensus through proof-of-work. The contents of the ledger are financial transactions–people sending and receiving Bitcoin currency to each other.</p><p>Since Bitcoin, there have been other cryptocurrencies that have similar properties–like Ethereum and the IPFS/Filecoin system. Similar to Bitcoin, they use a decentralized, proof of work based system with a currency reward system–but the ledger being maintained is not purely financial. A currency is a necessary component to maintaining the blockchain’s validity.</p><p>Over the next month, we will be exploring a variety of blockchain-based technologies. Some interviews will be high-level conversations that assume only a familiarity with cryptocurrencies. Some of them will be deeply technical, and assume a strong understanding of Bitcoin and Ethereum. And some episodes, like today’s episode, will be aimed at the developer who is in the process of “going down the rabbit hole.”</p><p>If you are finding yourself reading about Bitcoin and Ethereum a few hours every day, but you are still struggling to grasp the basics, this episode is for you. It is meant to be a complement to other introductory resources, such as “Mastering Bitcoin,” by Andreas Antonopoulos.</p><p>Cryptocurrency systems are revolutionary–they will unlock completely new applications in the very near future. It’s If you are trying to understand these decentralized currencies and applications, the best place to start is with Bitcoin. That’s why I was happy to have Daniel Van Flymen back on the show.</p><p>Daniel was previously on for one of our most popular episodes–”<a href="https://www.softwaredaily.com/#/post/59df362f4a8a50462d2b475e/Blockchain-Building-with-Daniel-van-Flymen">Blockchain Building</a>,” in which he talked about how useful it can be to build a blockchain based system for practice. Today, Daniel discusses the basics of Bitcoin transactions. What happens when you send money? How are transactions represented on the blockchain? How do full nodes and light clients interact with each other?</p><p>These are difficult topics to discuss purely over audio, so this episode is best listened to as a companion resource for someone who is studying cryptocurrencies.</p><p>If you are looking for an internship, apply to the Software Engineering Daily internship, at <a href="https://softwaredaily.com/jobs">softwaredaily.com/jobs</a>. And if you are looking to recruit engineers, you can post jobs for your company there as well–it’s completely free to post jobs and to apply.

Greg was one of the first engineers to start working on video streaming, which Netflix first attempted to implement with a set top box that downloaded movies and played them on your television. After evolving this strategy, Netflix arrived at the current model of video streaming through apps on browsers and mobile devices.</p><p>As the company pivoted from DVD-by-mail to video streaming, Netflix encountered multiple challenges across engineering, operations, and communications across the company. At the time, there was no “DevOps” movement. There were not established continuous delivery practices. The available cloud technologies were immature and low level.</p><p>Greg joins the show to describe the evolutionary arc of Netflix’s engineering process. <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vSERd2Brwwbiz_F-RJdaCrnizfTrAxBgtS8vggk08pFeoNy5Lf_iUZGufH0vrY0Frr3sUl6HOfZlDsl/pub?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000&amp;slide=id.g5773dbfab0_0_80">Greg also presents a model for software development that he describes as “Full Cycle Development”.</a> At Netflix, engineering teams of full cycle developers work without dedicated operations or testing teams. It is a sophisticated approach to engineering management.</p><p>I spoke to Greg at the <a href="https://fullstackradar.tikalk.com/">Fullstack Tech Radar Day</a>, a software conference in Tel-Aviv put on by <a href="https://www.tikalk.com/">Tikal</a>, an engineering community based out of Israel and San Francisco. This was a great conference, and we’ll be airing some additional content from it in the coming weeks.</p><p>We are hiring two interns for software engineering and business development! If you are interested in either position, send an email with your resume to <a href="mailto:jeff@softwareengineeringdaily.com">jeff@softwareengineeringdaily.com</a> with “Internship” in the subject line.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Demand for live streaming video over the internet is increasing. After the emergence of early live streaming platforms, like Twitch and Facebook Live, more forms of video have become accessible over live streams, such as sports. Live streaming is a harder engineering problem than delivering a static video file because the information distributed on a live stream is constantly changing.</p><p>DZN, spelled D-Z-N, is a live streaming service for watching fight events, such as boxing. The workloads for live streaming can be highly bursty. When a fight is scheduled to happen, the vast<br>\nmajority of traffic will hop on to watch the fight 20 seconds before the fight starts. A huge number of users logs into DZN and starts watching all at the same time. This quick spike in traffic means that DZN has to have servers spun up and be ready in advance.</p><p>Luca Mezzarlira and Yan Cui are engineers at DZN. Yan was previously on the show in a few amazing episodes to talk about serverless infrastructure and the complexities of real-time video game software development. Those episode links are in the show notes. I highly recommend checking them out. Today’s show is a discussion of architecting a system to handle a high bandwidth customer use case.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Google Cloud was started with a vision of providing Google infrastructure to the masses.</p><p>In 2008, it was not obvious that Google should become a cloud provider. Amazon Web Services was finding success among startups who needed on-demand infrastructure, but the traditional enterprise market was not yet ready to buy cloud resources. </p><p>Googlers liked the idea of becoming a cloud provider. But was it the right time to enter the market? Google’s advertising business was a large and growing cash cow. Executives within Google were not sure how much capital and effort should be allocated into an infrastructure business.</p><p>When Google decided to go into the cloud business, Joe Beda was one of the engineers who helped lead the effort, and joins the show as today’s guest.</p><p>Google’s internal server infrastructure is managed by Borg, a system for allocating resources to applications. Google Cloud runs on Borg, and there were a number of early engineering challenges to building the necessary functionality into Borg for running a cloud provider on top of it.</p><p>One example of a technical challenge that Google faced was the refactoring of Borg to run Google Cloud workloads.</p><p>The requirements for public infrastructure are different than those of internal Googlers. Inside of Google, developers deploy their applications to containers running on bare metal. Outside of Google, developers want to create virtual machines. Borg needed to be refactored in order to instantiate VMs.</p><p>Google solved this technical problem, as well as many other challenges, and Google Cloud slowly gained momentum in the market. But AWS remained the default choice for profitable enterprise workloads. It wasn’t until the container orchestration wars that Google found an opportunity to jump on a market segment that offered strong differentiation.</p><p>By open sourcing Kubernetes and presenting a clear vision for where the project was going, Google shifted the battlefield of the public cloud toward a competitive landscape where it has many advantages. Kubernetes also provided many other technology companies with an opportunity to get into the cloud market, creating a collaborative, multi-company ecosystem that has accelerated the pace of software faster than anyone expected.</p><p>Joe Beda has been instrumental in the evolution of the cloud native ecosystem. In today’s episode, Joe gives his memories on Google Cloud, Kubernetes, and his Kubernetes company Heptio, which he sold to VMware.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Modern applications store most of their data on hosted storage solutions. We use hosted block storage to back databases, hosted object storage for objects such as videos, and hosted file storage for file systems. Using a cloud provider for these storage systems can simplify scalability, durability, and availability–it can be less painful than taking care of storage yourself.</p><p>One downside: the storage systems offered by the cloud providers are not open source. The APIs might vary from provider to provider. Wiring your application to a particular storage service on a particular cloud could tightly couple you to that cloud.</p><p>Rook is a project for managing storage, built on Kubernetes. If you use a Rook cluster for your storage, you can port that storage model to any cloud, and have a consistent API for object, block, and file storage.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Modern programming requires lots of integration between APIs. Some of these integrations are trivial–such as using Twilio or Stripe. But there are many more complex integrations. </p><p>For example, when a large company acquires a smaller company, the acquiring company might want to integrate with that smaller company to leverage the synergies between the two companies. How do you build clean communication patterns between the services of one company and another?</p><p>Two teams within a single enterprise can also have integration issues. One team might have a different data model than the other team. One team might be using JSON and the other using XML. In these cases, integrations between APIs can take considerable time.</p><p>Ballerina is a programming language that is designed for writing integrations. Ballerina is made for building services that allow two APIs to communicate easily–in contrast to other patterns of API integration such as those involving an enterprise service bus.</p><p>Tyler Jewell is the CEO of WSO2, a company that specializes in integrations.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>At Facebook, Venkat Venkataramani saw how large volumes of data were changing software infrastructure. Applications such as logging servers and advertising were creating fast moving, semi-structured data. The user base was growing, the traffic was growing, and the volume of data was growing. And the popular methods for managing this data were insufficient for the applications that developers wanted to build on top.</p><p>In previous episodes about data platforms, we have covered similar <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/05/24/ubers-data-platform-with-zhenxiao-luo/">difficulties as experienced by Uber</a> and <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/08/16/doordash-engineering-with-raghav-ramesh/">Doordash</a>. Incoming data is often in JSON, which is hard to query. <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2017/01/13/columnar-data-apache-arrow-and-parquet-with-julien-le-dem-and-jacques-nadeau/">The data is transformed </a>to a file format like Parquet, which requires an ETL job. Once it is in a Parquet file on disk in a data lake, the access time is slow. To query the data efficiently, it must be loaded into a data warehouse, which loads the data into memory, often in a columnar format that is easy to aggregate.</p><p>Imagine being a developer at Facebook, Uber, or Doordash, and trying to build a simple dashboard, or a machine learning application on top of this data platform. Where do you find the right data? How do you know it is up to date? And what if you don’t know the shape of your queries ahead of time, and you haven’t defined indexes over your data? The access speed will be too slow to do exploratory analysis.</p><p>There are so many steps in this process, and each of these steps creates friction for application developers that want to build on top of “big data”. Since even Facebook was having trouble managing this problem of the data platform, Venkat figured there was an opportunity to build a company around solving the data platform for other software companies.</p><p>Venkat is the CEO of Rockset, a data system that is built to make it easy for developers to build data-driven apps. In Rockset, data can be ingested from data streams, data lakes, and databases. Rockset creates multiple indexes and schemas across the data. Because there are multiple models for querying, Rockset can analyze an incoming query and create an intelligent query plan for serving it.</p><p>Venkat joins the show to discuss his time working on data at Facebook, the untapped opportunities of using that data, and the architecture of Rockset.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Building software was simplified by cloud providers. With the cloud, it became much easier to deploy a server, spin up a database, and scale an application. Cloud providers like AWS gave developers access to these infrastructure primitives like storage and compute.</p><p>On top of those primitives, numerous API companies have been built. An API company offers a more specific set of services. Twilio offers SMS text messaging API services. Stripe offers payment API services. These APIs give developers another level of tooling to build software out of.</p><p>Developers can now think of entire applications in terms of APIs, and the number of APIs is growing rapidly. From business services such as booking a flight to machine learning models like image classification, the “API economy” has given developers a huge catalog of tools.</p><p>Since developers have this additional leverage, software can be built with smaller teams. The codebase can also be smaller. But one area where the complexity is growing is the number of APIs that need to be managed. For each API, there is a different system for integrating the API into your application. Different API providers have different levels of reliability.</p><p>Another area of difficulty is the discoverability of APIs. If I don’t know about a flight search API, I am never going to think of what applications I could build on top of that. There are APIs for generating memes, and APIs for easily querying what music is trending across the world.</p><p>RapidAPI is a marketplace for APIs. It includes search and discovery features for the wide variety of different APIs that can be found across the internet. RapidAPI is also a system for integrating with multiple APIs through it’s API management system.</p><p>Iddo Gino is the CEO and founder of RapidAPI, and he joins the show to discuss the motivation for creating an API marketplace, as well as the engineering behind RapidAPI.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Interviewing engineers is not a solved problem. Quite the opposite–everyone in the software industry will tell you their own personal issues with the hiring process. </p><p>One reason that technical interviews have not evolved significantly is the lack of standardized tooling. Some companies give you one phone screen, some give you two. Some companies have you solve brain teasers (“how many golf balls fit in a school bus”) and some make you fix bugs in their production codebase. During the on-site interview, some companies use whiteboards, some let you use a laptop.</p><p>Software companies do so much–they should be outsourcing the things that are not their core competency. Certainly they cannot outsource the entire hiring process–but they can outsource parts of it to a company like Interviewing.io.</p><p>Engineers come to Interviewing.io to practice their interview skills, where other engineers from top companies practice with them as an interviewer. When an engineer has practiced interviewing enough, they can use Interviewing.io to interview for real with real companies and find a job.</p><p>Aline Lerner is the CEO of Interviewing.io, and she knows about the software interviewing and recruiting process as much as anyone. After working as an engineer, she started studying recruiting, consulting with top companies to help them improve their process. From her observations, she created Interviewing.io. In this episode, we dissect the workflow that she created for engineers to improve at interviewing and find jobs, and also explore the insights that led her to starting Interviewing.io.</p><p>Transcript provided by We Edit Podcasts.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Artsy is an online art marketplace. This might sound like a simple engineering problem–you just set up a basic ecommerce site, list some pieces of art, and start making money, right? </p><p>The art world is complicated. There are four major pillars: patrons, art fairs, galleries, and auctions. Bringing these different parts online is not trivial. And in order to do so, Artsy has to work with the existing ecosystem. It is not like the taxi industry, where you can aggressively compete against the pre-existing businesses. The art world is built around relationships and trust.</p><p>The engineering is hard too. An art auction results in a transaction for millions of dollars. In this way, building an auction system is like building a trading system. Latency needs to be very low, and you can’t make any mistakes or else customers could suffer to the tune of millions of dollars.</p><p>Daniel Doubrovkine is the CTO of Artsy, and he joins me to describe the complexities of the art market and the engineering challenges that come with building a software company around it.</p><p>Transcript provided by We Edit Podcasts.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Steve Herrod led engineering at VMWare as the company scaled from 30 engineers to 3,000 engineers. After 11 years, he left to become a managing director for General Catalyst, a venture capital firm. Since he has both operating experience and a wide view of the technology landscape as an investor, he is well-equipped to discuss a topic that we have been covering on Software Engineering Daily: the integration of cloud and edge computing.</p><p>Today, we think of the cloud as a network of large data centers operated by big players like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft. The cloud is where most of the computation across the world takes place. My smartphone and laptop are “edge” devices. They are lightweight computers that don’t perform much complex processing. I would not be able to run a large production database or a 3 terabyte MapReduce job on my laptop.</p><p>The current division of labor makes sense in this world of smart clouds and low-power, low-bandwidth devices. But the devices are getting cheaper, smarter, and more proliferate. Cars, drones, security cameras, sensors and other devices can serve as points of computation that are geographically between the edge devices and the cloud. With more devices between you and the cloud, there is an opportunity to put computation on those devices.</p><p>Everyone knows that cloud and edge computing will become intermingled in the coming years. But predicting just how it will play out is nearly impossible. And as an investor, if you bet on something too early, you get the same result as someone who was wrong altogether.</p><p>A good analogy for the “cloud and edge” space of investments might be the “smart home.” Everyone knows the smart home is coming eventually, but it’s very hard to tell how long it will be before smart home systems are in widespread use–so it is an open question how to invest in the space. </p><p>Summer internship applications to Software Engineering Daily are also being accepted. If you are interested in working with us on the Software Engineering Daily open source project full-time this Summer, send an application to <a href="mailto:internships@softwareengineeringdaily.com">internships@softwareengineeringdaily.com</a>.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>How would you build a system for indexing and monitoring the entire Internet?</p><p>Start by breaking the Internet up into IP address ranges. Give each of those address ranges to servers distributed around the world. On each of those servers, iterate through your list of IP addresses, sending packets to them. Depending on what sorts of packets those IP addresses respond to, and what those responses are, you can build a map of the devices on the Internet: what is running on those devices, and what they respond to.</p><p>Qadium is a company that indexes and monitors devices on the Internet, to help organizations understand the devices that are within corporate networks. If you are a large corporation, Qadium can probably do a better job of figuring out your Internet footprint than you can.</p><p>Matt Kraning is the CTO of Qadium, and in today’s show he describes the process by which Qadium maps the Internet. Matt used to work on data infrastructure at DARPA, and has deployed Hadoop in Afghanistan–so the infrastructure of Qadium seems relatively manageable.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>The Netflix API is accessed by developers who build for over 1000 device types: TVs, smartphontes, VR headsets, laptops. If it has a screen, it can probably run Netflix. On each of these different devices, the Netflix experience is different. Different screen sizes mean there is variable space to display the content.</p><p>When you open up Netflix, you want to efficiently browse through movies. The frontend engineers who are building different experiences for different device types need to make different requests to the backend to fetch the right amount of data. This was the engineering problem that Vasanth Asokan and his team at Netflix was tasked with solving: how do you enable lots of different frontend engineers to get whatever they need from the backend?</p><p>This problem led to the development of a “serverless-like platform” within Netflix, which Vasanth wrote about in a <a href="https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/developer-experience-lessons-operating-a-serverless-like-platform-at-netflix-part-ii-63a376c28228">few popular</a> <a href="https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/developer-experience-lessons-operating-a-serverless-like-platform-at-netflix-part-ii-63a376c28228">articles on Medium</a>. This platform enables frontend developers to write and deploy backend scripts to fetch data, decoupling the responsibilities of frontend engineers and backend engineers.</p><p>The tight coupling of frontend and backend engineering was problematic to the development velocity of Netflix.</p><p>We have done many shows about Netflix engineering, covering topics like data engineering, user interface design, and performance monitoring.

A Bloomberg terminal contains news, stock prices, communication tools, and other features that make it worth a high subscription price. And people in finance can afford to pay that high subscription because their decisions can cause a gain or loss of thousands of dollars.</p><p>Cryptocurrency investors have a similar set of informational problems as traditional financiers. There is a flood of information. Financial quotes are inconsistent across different exchanges. Opinions from Twitter and reddit can be tremendously useful—if they are captured and leveraged correctly.</p><p>Santiment is a platform that is working to build a Bloomberg terminal for the cryptocurrency investor.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Engineering organizations can operate more efficiently by working with a continuous integration and continuous deployment workflow. Continuous integration is the process of automatically building and deploying code that gets pushed to a remote repository. Continuous deployment is the process of moving that code through a pipeline of environments, from dev to test to production. At each stage, the engineers feel increasingly safe that the code will not break the user experience.</p><p>When a company adopts Kubernetes, the workflow for deploying software within that company might need to be refactored. If the company starts to deploy containers in production, and managing those containers using Kubernetes, the company will also want to have a testing pipeline that emulates the production environment using containers and Kubernetes.</p><p>Sheroy Marker is the head of technology at ThoughtWorks products, where he works on GoCD, a continuous delivery tool. Sheroy joins the show to talk about how Kubernetes affects continuous delivery workflows, and the process of building out Kubernetes integrations for GoCD. </p><p>We also discussed the landscape of continuous delivery tools–why there are so many continuous delivery tools, and the question of how to choose a continuous delivery product if you are implementing CD. Continuous delivery tooling is in some ways like the space of monitoring, logging, and analytics–there are lots of successful products in the market.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash are two cryptocurrencies with similar properties. But the supporters of each of these Bitcoin versions have strongly divergent opinions on the direction of the Bitcoin project. At the center of this debate is the subject of block size.</p><p>Bitcoin’s block size determines how many transactions fit into each block that is mined. A larger block size leads to faster transactions and lower fees, but creates higher demands on mining hardware. A smaller block size leads to a slower on-chain network and higher fees, but allows the full nodes on the network to be run on low performance hardware like Raspberry Pi.</p><p>Bitcoin Cash has a large block size. Bitcoin Core has a smaller block size. Proponents of the smaller block size argue that Bitcoin’s scaling can be achieved by the off-chain “lightning network” solution.</p><p>Roger Ver is a Bitcoin entrepreneur and investor. Since he discovered the currency, he has been buying it and evangelizing it. More recently, Roger has become an ardent supporter of Bitcoin Cash–emphasizing that Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin.</p><p>In this episode, Roger describes his economic ideology, and explains why Bitcoin is so important to him. We explore how vested interests can shape the narrative and the direction of Bitcoin, and talk about the future of how corporations, governments, and individuals might be using cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Transcript provided by We Edit Podcasts.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Advertising fraud steals billions of dollars every year. </p><p>BuzzFeed reporter Craig Silverman reports on advertising fraud and its impact on the Internet. In one investigation, <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/how-a-massive-ad-fraud-scheme-exploited-android-phones-to?bfsource=relatedmanual">Craig uncovered a mobile advertising fraud scheme in which four people stole millions of dollars (perhaps as much as $75 million or even $750 million)</a> by serving advertisements to automated users on mobile apps.</p><p>The scheme worked as follows:</p><p>This scheme was easy to pull off. It did not require much sophistication in terms of engineering or business skills. If a group of four people can generate tens of millions of dollars, how much ill-gotten capital is being generated by large corporations that are deeply involved in the advertising market?</p><p>Craig’s article went viral, and he has followed it up with other pieces about <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/ad-fraud-scheme-stole-millions-advertising-industry">ad networks</a>, <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/3ve-botnet-ad-fraud-fbi-takedown">fraud investigations by Google</a>, and <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/android-apps-cheetah-mobile-kika-kochava-ad-fraud">the potential for mobile apps to be used for large scale surveillance of Americans by the Chinese.</a></p><p>Craig is the most dedicated reporter covering advertising fraud today. His work is invaluable because he is asking difficult questions about the economics of our Internet. As we discuss in the episode, there is currently no effective automated means of detecting a bot from a human on the internet.</p><p>We have also discussed this in detail on previous episodes about <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2016/12/13/ad-fraud-everywhere-with-shailin-dhar/">ad fraud</a>, <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2017/11/02/bad-men-with-bob-hoffman/">the advertising industry</a>, <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2017/09/16/advertising-analytics-with-jonah-goodhart/">advertising analytics</a>, and <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2016/12/20/ad-fraud-research-with-augustine-fou/">the techniques of ad fraud</a>. </p><p>Ad fraud is not the fault of any one party. It is an emergent result of the way that our Internet is set up. It is as hard to imagine a world without advertising fraud as it is to imagine a world without email spam.</p>',

But developers are already building augmented reality applications for smartphones using Apple ARKit and Android ARCore. These augmented reality toolkits use powerful smartphone processors and computer vision to give developers simple primitives for placing and manipulating 3-D objects.</p><p>Most of these AR applications are made for a single phone, and AR is useful for a single phone–for example, you could hold your phone up in front of an empty room, and see on your phone how it would look if you had an IKEA couch sitting in the middle of that room.</p><p>But shared augmented reality experiences are much more exciting.</p><p>Shared augmented reality can allow us to play a game of virtual basketball, both controlling the game that is synchronized between us. Shared AR would let me go to a restaurant, and create a virtual billboard in front of the restaurant that only you could see when you walked up to the restaurant and held your phone in front of you.</p><p>Ubiquity6 is a company with the goal of enabling shared AR experiences. Ankit Kumar is the co-founder and CTO of Ubiquity6, and he joins the show to explain why building shared AR is a challenging technical problem. It requires building a digital model of the real world, and mapping that model to coordinates in space, so that users can reliably persist augmented reality objects that each other can see.</p><p>We discuss computer vision, digital mapping, the increasing power of phone processors, and the potential of shared AR.</p>',

In 2010, cloud was just starting to become popular. There was a gap in the market for infrastructure monitoring tools, which Alexis helped fill with the first version of Datadog. </p><p>Since 2010, the number of different cloud infrastructure products has proliferated. There were new databases, queueing systems, virtualization and containerization tools. Web 2.0 took off, and thousands of new Internet businesses got started. Many of these businesses used Datadog to monitor their increasingly wide range of infrastructure configurations–and Datadog began to scale.</p><p>On today’s show, Alexis tells the story of how Datadog grew from its first product into a variety of tools–infrastructure monitoring, logging, and application performance monitoring. Monitoring is a unique challenge–there is a ton of data, the data is latency sensitive, and the data is operationally important. These engineering constraints provide for a great conversation.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Back in 2014, platform-as-a-service was becoming an increasingly popular idea. The idea of PaaS was to sit on top of infrastructure-as-a-service providers like Azure, AWS, or Google Cloud, and simplify some of the complexity of these infrastructure providers. Heroku had built a successful businesses from the idea of platform-as-a-service, and there was a widely held desire in the developer community to have an “open source Heroku.”</p><p>One project that was working towards the idea of an open source platform-as-a-service was Deis. Deis made it easier for people to deploy and manage their applications, and it simplified some of the hard parts of container management. When Kubernetes came out, Deis got refactored to use Kubernetes under the hood for container orchestration. Deis was one of the first projects to use Kubernetes as a tool to build a platform-as-a-service, and the team that was working on Deis got very early exposure to the process of building a platform on top of Kubernetes. </p><p>Michelle Noorali was one of the engineers on the Deis team. When Deis got acquired by Microsoft, Michelle was working on Helm, a package manager for distributed systems. Helm allows developers to deploy distributed applications on top of Kubernetes more easily. A few examples of distributed applications that can be deployed using Helm are Kafka, Prometheus, and IPFS. One reason Helm is so useful is that distributed systems are notoriously hard to configure and run.</p><p>Since joining Microsoft, Michelle has continued to work on Helm. She is also a member of the Kubernetes Steering Committee and the board of the CNCF. Michelle joins the show to talk about her early experiences building PaaS and her perspective on the Kubernetes ecosystem. Full disclosure: Microsoft is a sponsor of Software Engineering Daily.</p>',

Most users only have a single bank account, making it a tool for identity and authentication. The series of transactions in a bank account provides a data set that can be used for analyzing payment history and issuing loans, or insurance.</p><p>But there are difficulties to building a platform on top of banking. There are thousands of different banks.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>A smart security camera takes in a high volume of video images and processes those images using a set of machine learning models. Those models can be used to identify interesting snippets of movement throughout the day, and decide which of those snippets to keep. Some of the video snippets might contain movement of birds–but other video snippets might contain footage of intruders.</p><p>As the video stream is processed on the smart security camera, and machine learning models are used to classify the entities in the video stream, some of the data gets thrown out as useless. Some of the data gets sent to the cloud for additional processing. Some of the data might trigger an alert that there is an intruder on the premises. Each piece of video data is an “event”. These events are processed and acted upon.</p><p>Modern applications are highly interactive, and have lots of “events”. Other examples of event data streams are website traffic data, self-driving car data, time-series logging data, and video game session data. Building applications that respond to these high volumes of events requires us to program triggers to react to data streams, actions to take in response to the data streams, and workflows to orchestrate what the overall picture of our application is doing as the application is consuming this large data stream.</p><p>Flogo is an event-driven ecosystem for building applications around streams of events. Leon Stigter and Matt Ellis work on Flogo at TIBCO, and they join the show to discuss event-driven application development and their work on Flogo. They also talk about the constraints of machine learning applications at the edge, and how event processing systems like Flogo can be used to handle large data streams on edge devices.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>A token is a unit of virtual currency. Most tokens are built on a blockchain-based cryptocurrency platform, such as Ethereum. Building on top of a platform like Ethereum allows these tokens to form their own financial ecosystem while leveraging the scale of an existing currency. </p><p>Tokens became highly popular in early 2018, with the boom in ICOs–initial coin offerings. Many of these coins offer a value proposition of a “utility token.” The idea of a utility token is that the token is necessary to transact in a particular ecosystem. If Amazon were to require you to convert US dollars to Amazon coins in order to buy items on Amazon, the Amazon coin would be a “utility token.” There are many different kinds of utility token schemes, and time will tell if this model makes sense for the cryptocurrency investment landscape.</p><p>Another type of token is the “security token,” in which a token represents a share in an organization. This token type is more like a stock, or bond, or certificate of ownership of a financial instrument. These types of tokens also have their share of criticism. If I start a company, most of my assets are not represented on a blockchain–the assets are things like hiring contracts, intellectual property, real estate, etc. The legal ownership of these assets is settled by a complicated legal system which has no notion of a blockchain. It’s unclear how the claims of a security token today would be enforced–or why a security token is presently a better option for raising capital than traditional equity or debt instruments.</p><p>Felipe Pereira is the author of “<a href="https://medium.com/paratii/on-the-immaturity-of-tokenized-value-capture-mechanisms-1fde33f2bc8e">On the immaturity of tokenized value capture mechanisms,</a>” a Medium article in which he documents different types of token systems, including several flavors of utility tokens and security tokens. He’s also the co-founder at a company called Paratii. He joins the show to discuss the present viability of token-based systems–and what blockchains have actually proven to be useful for today. </p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Creating a software company has never been easier. Software engineers are increasingly seeing entrepreneurship as a viable career path. But the path to being an independent software developer is not always clear. </p><p>Most engineers spend some of their career working at a software company. Even an engineer who intends to build a company someday can thrive within the right environment.</p><p>Lior Kanfi is a software engineer and the founder of Tikal, a company he started at the height of the dot com bubble in 1999. His initial vision for the company was to build a product around managing knowledge and people within a company. </p><p>When the dot com bubble burst in the year 2000, it became much harder to run a product-focused business. Companies were not buying lots of experimental software, and investors were not aggressively funding new software companies. After the market collapsed, Lior shifted Tikal from a product-focused company into consulting, in order to have a more reliable income stream.</p><p>Today, Tikal is a successful software consultancy based in Israel and the Bay Area. Lior describes the engineers within Tikal as “free radical” software developers: independent people who want to learn about new technologies and build experience interacting with clients.</p><p>Lior joins the show to talk about his 20 year journey building Tikal and the differences between engineers in the Bay Area and those in Israel. Lior also hosted the <a href="https://fullstackradar.tikalk.com/">Full Stack Tech Radar Day in Tel Aviv</a>, which was a great conference I attended.</p>',

He started at TIBCO, then spent time at Google and VMWare. When he was at VMWare, he architected the open source platform Cloud Foundry. While working on Cloud Foundry, Derek developed NATS, a messaging control plane.</p><p>Since that time, Derek has started two companies–Apcera and Synadia Communications. In our conversation, Derek and I discussed the history of message brokers, how NATS compares to Kafka, and his ideas for how NATS could scale in the future to become something much more than a centralized message bus.</p><p>Transcript provided by We Edit Podcasts.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Netflix has petabytes of data and thousands of workloads running across that data every day. These workloads generate movie recommendations for users, create dashboards for data analysts to study, and reshape data in ETL jobs, to make it more accessible across the organization.</p><p>Over the last ten years, data engineering has become a key component of what makes Netflix successful. There are many different engineering roles who interact with the data infrastructure–including data analyst, machine learning scientist, analytics engineer, and software engineer.</p><p>Data engineering at Netflix has come a long way from the days of Hadoop MapReduce jobs running nightly, and generating reports of the most popular movies.</p><p>As data engineering and data science has grown, the tooling has expanded. The people in different data roles at Netflix might use Apache Spark, Presto, Python, Scala, SQL, and many other applications to study data–but in recent years, there is one tool that has stood out for its ability to be distinctly useful: Jupyter Notebooks.</p><p>A Jupyter Notebook lets users create and share documents that contain live code, visualizations, documentation, and many other types of components. In some ways, it is like a shareable IDE, that allows other people to see how you are working with your code and why you are making certain decisions. It is also a tool for building interactive, user-friendly applications–you can embed videos and images in a Jupyter notebook.</p><p>A Jupyter Notebook stores both the code and the results together in one place. By combining code with results in one document, you can have context around why a certain result came out the way it did.</p><p>Matthew Seal is a senior software engineer at Netflix, where he builds infrastructure and internal tools around Jupyter Notebooks. He joins the show to explain what problems Jupyter Notebooks solve for Netflix, and why they have quickly grown in popularity within the company.</p><p>Transcript provided by We Edit Podcasts.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>In the 1980s and the 1990s, most applications used only a relational database for their data management. In the early 2000s, software projects started to use an ever increasing number of data sources. MongoDB popularized the document database, which allows storage of objects that do not have a consistent schema.</p><p>The Hadoop distributed file system enabled the redundant storage and efficient querying of high volumes of data that are spread out across multiple commodity disks. The Cassandra Database is a hybrid between key-value storage and column-oriented storage.</p><p>The benefit of these different data systems is that you can choose a system that gives you the read and write performance that you need. The downside is that each of these databases has different querying semantics. If you’re a developer trying to access data from your application, you often need to know how to access that data from the specific data source and whether that data needs to be queried with SQL, or with the document style query, or with a MapReduce job.</p><p>Spring Data is a project to standardize the programming model for data access within Spring. The vision for the project is to give Spring developers a consistent way to access their data from any database, or retaining the performance characteristics of those databases.</p><p>Spring is a Java framework for writing web applications, but this conversation is useful even for people who are not building these Spring applications. Whatever application you’re building, you are probably pulling from multiple data sources. The question of how to abstract away the complexity of those multiple data sources is also being tackled by projects such as GraphQL and Falcor.</p><p>John Blum is a staff engineer who works on the Spring Data Project at Pivotal. He joins the show to discuss how to design a data access layer. We discussed the API between a database and the Spring Data layer and also talked about reactive programming. Reactive programming allows the application layer to respond to changes in the underlying data layer.</p><p>I interviewed John at SpringOne Platform, which is a conference that is organized by Pivotal, who full disclosure is a sponsor of Software Engineering Daily. This week’s episodes are all conversations from that conference.</p><p>If there’s a conference that you think I should attend and do some coverage at, please let me know. Whether you like this format or not, I would love to get your feedback. We have some big developments coming for Software Engineering Daily in 2018, and we want to have a closer dialogue with the listeners.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Searching through all of the videos on the Internet is not a simple problem. </p><p>In order to search through all the videos, you need to build a search index. In order to build a search index, you need to build a web crawler. Video files are large. To store all of the actual video files would cost far too much money. In order to build an index in a cost-efficient manner, you need to have a way of storing information about a video without storing the entire video itself.</p><p>You might be thinking “hasn’t Google already solved video search? Why are we even talking about this?” Google has solved some aspects of video search–but a different set of challenges is being tackled by a video search company called Pex. </p><p>In order to explain what Pex is building, we should first explain the problem set they are trying to tackle.</p><p>Videos across the internet are consumed on a variety of platforms such as YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, and Vimeo. These videos are sliced up, bootlegged, and repurposed from one platform to another. For content creators who earn their living from their hosted video streams, this can be a nightmare. </p><p>Imagine you are a musician, and you make lots of money from music videos. You upload your cool new video to YouTube, and it instantly gets bootlegged by other users and shared across the internet in hundreds of different places. When people watch the stolen versions of your video, you are not getting compensated. If you could locate all of those stolen videos, you could order them to take it down, or claim the video so that you are paid for it. </p><p>And here is the engineering problem–how can you find all those re-posted videos? By crawling the web and building a search index for every video on the web.</p><p>Rasty Turek is the CEO of Pex, and in this episode he describes how to build a system that crawls the Internet and indexes videos. It’s a large scale engineering challenge, and there are lots of tradeoffs to be made between financial cost, speed, accuracy, and engineering complexity.</p><p>Transcript provided by We Edit Podcasts.

A data scientist who is developing a model is often working with different tools, or a smaller data set, or different hardware than the environment which that model will be deployed to.</p><p>This problem existed at Uber just as it does at many other companies. Models were difficult to release, iterations were complicated, and collaboration between engineers could never reach a point that resembled a harmonious “DevOps”-like workflow. To address these problems, Uber developed an internal system called Michelangelo.</p><p>Some of the engineers working on Michelangelo within Uber realized that there was a business opportunity in taking the Michelangelo work and turning it into a product company. Thus, Tecton was born. Tecton is a machine learning platform focused on solving the same problems that existed within Uber.

When a developer rents this infrastructure via an API call, a virtual server is instantiated on physical machines. That virtual server needs to be made addressable through the allocation of an IP address to make it reachable from the open Internet. When the virtual server starts to receive too much traffic, that traffic needs to be load balanced with another virtual server.</p><p>The backend networking code that runs a cloud provider needs to be fast, secure, and memory-efficient. Languages that fit that description include C++, Rust, and Go. Digital Ocean’s low-level networking code is mostly written in Go.</p><p>Sneha Inguva is an engineer with Digital Ocean who has written and spoken about writing networking applications using Go.

To understand Google’s strategy, it is useful to first set the context for the current competitive environment of cloud providers. </p><p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) popularized cloud computing in 2006. AWS was first to market, which has given the company a large competitive advantage over the rest of the industry. It took Google several years to realize how big the public cloud market was, and how good the economics of running a cloud provider could be. Microsoft also realized the opportunity several years after AWS was started.</p><p>The multi-year lead that AWS had on getting to market has given the company tremendous leverage. Because AWS is the most widely trusted, accepted default in the market, AWS is able to deepen that relationship more and more over time, despite the fact that the proprietary APIs of AWS create a level of lock-in that bears some resemblance to the lock-in of Microsoft Windows or Oracle’s relational database systems.</p><p>The brief history of software gives us examples of what is supposed to happen next.</p><p>When a large company is operating a proprietary developer platform, the open source software ecosystem reflexively comes out with an alternative, open source solution that is better than the proprietary system, right? We saw this with the Linux project, which channeled the developer resentment of the proprietary Windows operating system software into the development of the best server operating system to date: Linux.</p><p>The difference between Microsoft Windows in the 90s and AWS today is that, for the most part, developers do not resent AWS. AWS keeps its prices low, and embodies a spirit of innovation despite the fact that AWS is partly built around a repeated process of taking open source projects, packaging them up into cloud services, and integrating them closely with other AWS tools, making it harder to move away from AWS.</p><p>In its pioneering offerings of managed services, AWS made it easier to set up tools that had previously been impossible for less-experienced developers to operate. Distributed systems became approachable. Companies like Netflix, Lyft, and Heroku were built on the simplified operational model of AWS.</p><p>AWS also innovates outside of this business model of repackaging open source projects.</p><p>When AWS pioneered the function-as-a-service model, they created an easy way to scale stateless computation. They presented the developer world with an entirely new compute model: event-driven programming, with services communicating to each other via functional glue code running in cheap, transient containers.</p><p>There is strong criticism of the event-driven, AWS Lambda-bound “serverless” compute model. And those critics make a valid point: AWS Lambda is a proprietary API.</p><p>To build your app around an event-driven architecture glued together with Lambda functions is to lock yourself tightly to Amazon infrastructure. But the critics of this model do not seem to be the ones who are actually locked in. Critics of Amazon’s proprietary strategy tend to be those with a strong incentive to be critical.</p><p>Another common criticism of AWS comes from commercial open source companies such as Redis Labs and Elastic, which are vendors of the Redis open source in-memory data system, and the open source Elasticsearch search and retrieval system respectively. These vendors argue that AWS has violated the spirit of open source by repackaging open source software as profitable software and failing to contribute back to the open source ecosystem with commensurate open source contributions. </p><p>AWS has repackaged both Redis and Elasticsearch as AWS Elasticache and Amazon Elasticsearch Service respectively.</p><p>These vendors frame their relationship to AWS as zero sum, and are turning to licensing changes as their strategy of choice for creating a new defensible moat against AWS. In various Internet forums, the indignant commercial open source software vendors and AWS have both made their cases to the developer community.</p><p>If you are a developer who just wants to build your software, these arguments are an unsettling distraction. In addition to worrying about fault tolerance and durability guarantees and cost management, you now have to worry about licensing.</p><p>And as you observe these circumstances, with open source vendors accusing cloud providers of improper behavior, you might begin to wonder: what actually are the rules of open source? By what set of commandments are we judging who is good and who is bad?</p><p>And who is to judge what is fair or unfair activity by Amazon, which was the first company to prove to all of us just how influential cloud computing could be?</p><p>This is the competitive landscape of the cloud circa April 2019, when I attended Google Cloud Next, Google’s annual cloud developer conference.</p><p>Throughout the conference, the optimism and playful spirit of Google was present everywhere. There were colorful shapes and cartoonish diagrams that looked like building blocks made for children. In the expo hall, there were food pillars from which free candy and salted snacks could be grabbed all day long.</p><p>On one side of the expo hall, a demonstration from IKEA showed how the company was partnering with Google to run its business more like a software company. Stretching across the expo hall in a carpeted distance of multiple football fields, the various vendors showed off their latest wares in a bazaar of multicloud, hybrid cloud, and Kubernetes-compliant sales pitches.</p><p>Over the last decade, large enterprises have opened up their wallets more and more, realizing just how valuable cloud infrastructure can be for their businesses. The more they spend, the more efficient their workers become, and the faster their businesses can improve. For modern enterprise, the cloud is the closest thing to magic that we have.</p><p>Knowledge workers are becoming unshackled from the painful, slow pace of early technological corporatism. The cloud can empower all of us–and rather than replacing our jobs with machines, the cloud will allow us to better express our humanity within our work.</p><p>The twin forces of consumer mobile computing on the client side and cloud computing on the server side are compounding faster than we can measure. Five years ago, a common analogy was to compare the smartphone to a “remote control for your life”. Today the smartphone feels more like a magic wand than a remote control. We can summon tremendous forces from the magical cloud by merely speaking the right command into our wand-like smartphone.</p><p>The effects on corporate enterprise operations are exciting to watch.<a href="https://jeffmeyerson.com/the-expo-hall-track"> I go to a lot of conferences, and I prefer to walk around the expo hall rather than to go to any sessions.</a> At the expo hall, you see the distance between vendor hype and the realities of the enterprise. From my vantage point, that distance gets shorter every year: enterprises truly are adopting DevOps, continuous delivery, machine learning, and data platforms.</p><p>From insurance companies to banks to farming companies to furniture outlets: the “digital transformation” is actually happening. This is great for consumers, and great for employees at the large corporations that are being digitally transformed.</p><p>What is it like to work at a large, 100 year old enterprise that is going through digital transformation? It is certainly much more appealing than it was a decade ago.</p><p>The servile, bureaucratic, rent-seeking hierarchies of the 80s, 90s, and early 2000s are slowly being refurbished into enterprises where bottoms-up innovation, individualism, and artistic energy are assets rather than liabilities. We are moving out of the age of boring cubicle industrialism towards a vision in which work is truly creative and fulfilling for every member of the corporation.</p><p>And Google evangelizes this ideal stronger than any other company in the world.</p><p>With its tremendous cash flows from its advertising business, Google reinvests heavily into its employee base. Many employees at Google have worked there for a decade and show no intention of leaving, having found a job, but more importantly a culture and an engineering environment that is unrivaled.</p><p>Speaking subjectively: my sense is that Google’s internal engineering tools are the best in the world. For many years, Google has been the strongest magnet for talent in the realm of Internet infrastructure and machine learning. In terms of sophistication, the rest of the software industry has been playing catch-up to Google since the days of the MapReduce paper.</p><p>Speaking of the MapReduce paper: even in those early days, Google was willing to share its findings with the outside world. Google was tactical about which innovations it would open up about, but it does seem that Google has truly tried to embody some of the publishing philosophies of academia.</p><p>Google’s early investments in an academic-like environment have borne considerable fruit. The curiosity and cross-institutional collaboration enabled by Google’s willingness to speak openly about its research have made Google a refuge for academics, including today’s guest Eric Brewer.</p><p>Beyond its considerable contributions as a publisher of computer science theory, Google has also become the model software engineering practitioner.</p><p>Google has scaled its internal tools to make its thousands of developers highly productive. Given its success with its internal developers, it should come as no surprise that Google has strong opinions about the best way to build services for external developers.</p><p>I have often wondered what it is actually like to work within Google as an engineer. I have worked at Amazon, and seen their internal tooling. At Amazon, the level of tooling gave engineers tremendous leverage. But from talking to more experienced engineers, my sense is that nobody holds a candle to the internal tools of Google.</p><p><a href="https://www.softwaredaily.com/post/5cb6efdd0e4713000c0f6e16/Drishti-Deep-Learning-for-Manufacturing-with-Krish-Chaudhury">Drishti CTO Krish Chaudhury was a recent guest on this podcast</a>. He spent nearly a decade at Google working on computer vision projects. Today he is building his own computer vision company. When I asked him if we yet had “Google Infrastructure for Everyone”, he sighed deeply and wistfully before answering with an unequivocal “no”.</p><p>This hints at what Google wants to do with its cloud. Google does not think of Google Cloud as commodity cloud computing services. The vision for Google Cloud is to be the premier cloud, the deluxe set of services that provides “Google Infrastructure For Everyone”.</p><p>This is a moonshot, and in order to accomplish it, Google will need to forego certain short term opportunities for cash grabs. But it is undoubtedly a more fiscally wise strategy for Google to optimize growth of the 2029 Q3 cloud market rather than that of 2019 Q3.</p><p>From a conglomerate standpoint, Google already has a cash cow. Google has won today’s war, and it only makes sense to focus on tomorrow’s.</p><p>In Google’s approach to the cloud, we see a cultural distinction between Amazon and Google. The cultures of Amazon and Google are partly deliberate, but partly driven by the nature of their businesses’ respective revenue streams.</p><p>Amazon built its e-commerce business in a low-margin, highly competitive environment. Amazon won its customers over through a slow process of building trust. In its delivery of physical goods, Amazon formed close relationships with customers. Amazon would repeatedly listen to these customers and use that feedback to improve their products. This “flywheel” of iterative improvement is the core engine that keeps Amazon improving incrementally.</p><p>Amazon also has made far-flung, ambitious investments–but the size and scope of Amazon’s moonshots was constrained for many years by its lack of any singularly large cash cow. Fire Phone notwithstanding, Amazon’s moonshots have often been thrifty asymmetric bets, requiring minimal upfront investment but presenting huge potential payoff.</p><p>Google, on the other hand, has been in a much more luxurious financial position for most of its life.</p><p>Google has a high margin advertising business that accounts for ~84% of its revenues, subsidizing everything else in Google (and Alphabet). Because it has such a big cash cow in a totally different area of the business, Google can afford to take an extremely long-term approach to its vision for the cloud. For Google, the goal is not to maximize the profit margins of the cloud over the next two years. Google can afford to think of cloud profitability in the increment of decades.</p><p>In the business of cloud computing, Google has turned the weakness of being a late mover into a wide set of strengths.</p><p>The AWS console presents its users with a sprawling array of possibilities. Google Cloud has a lower surface area. Google is more opinionated about the right way to do things–and it is easier for Google to build in an opinionated fashion because there are fewer legacy customers and edge cases to support. AWS supports the majority of the market, so it is in a position where it must keep those customers happy in order to hold onto its moat.</p><p>So what are Google’s strong opinions about the way that a cloud should operate?</p><p>Google’s espoused vision is that of the “open cloud”: a cloud environment where organizations could easily move workloads from one cloud provider to another.</p><p>If we take the purest, most aspirational interpretation of “open cloud”, the full stack would be open source. Identity and access management systems would be portable as well, and cloud providers would work together to reduce the switching costs between each other, even in cases of data gravity.</p><p>As virtuous as the idea of the “open cloud” sounds, it is also strategically convenient for Google. Since it lags behind Amazon and Microsoft in terms of adoption, a gradual shift towards a widely standardized open cloud would theoretically make it easier for Google to recover market share as the cloud market matures.</p><p>Whatever Google’s true motives are, the “open cloud” strategy has been tremendously bountiful to the developer community.</p><p>By open sourcing Kubernetes and pouring resources into it, Google brought an end to the painful, wasteful container orchestration wars. In its donation of Kubernetes to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (which it also is a heavy financial donor to), Google created an ostensibly open, positive sum environment for the rivaling cloud providers to congregate productively.</p><p>In the area of machine learning, Google open sourced TensorFlow and invested heavily into tutorials, documentation, YouTube videos, and other resources. Google built JavaScript libraries and auditability and visualization tools. Google has marshalled an entire ecosystem around TensorFlow.</p><p>Some of Google’s commercial open source efforts have had less favorable results.</p><p>The Istio service mesh project seems to have been promoted with the same playbook that Kubernetes and TensorFlow followed, but with a less usable tool. In Istio, we see Google’s expertise in advertising perhaps taken too far.</p><p>Why is Istio a problematic case study?</p><p>Because, despite the fact that there are multiple<a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/12/19/linkerd-service-mesh-with-william-morgan/"> open</a> <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2019/04/11/consul-service-mesh-with-paul-banks/">source</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nginx">service</a> <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2019/01/04/kong-api-platform-with-marco-palladino/">mesh</a> products on the market with significant production usage, Istio has managed to make so much noise about itself that it is convincing the market that the battle for service mesh superiority is a foregone conclusion.</p><p>From the blog posts, to the KubeCon programming to the expo hall hype, the cloud native developer community has been hammered with the same messaging about service mesh: Istio is the best, don’t bother with the rest.</p><p>Perhaps Google is just doing us all a favor with Istio. Maybe it really is the best service mesh, just not for workloads that serve production. Or maybe Google is just ironing out the kinks, and the marketing roadmap happened to proceed at a faster pace than the engineering roadmap. Honestly, I don’t really know.</p><p>In any case, I’m not passing judgment on whether Google has done something morally wrong by pushing Istio prematurely. I just think it was strategically unwise. With Istio, Google made it a little too obvious just how much narrative control it has over the public developer market.</p><p>Perhaps this narrative control should come as no surprise. Of all the major clouds, Google is the most well-versed in open source. From its contributions to Linux to its maintenance of a complicated Android ecosystem, Google knows how to play its cards in the game of open source diplomacy.</p><p>In battle, a classic strategy for competing with a rival that has an advantage is to force that rival onto territory that you are more familiar with. There are many historical cases where a small army was able to defeat a large army due to its ability to maneuver the battle front to a favorable environment.</p><p>Through its open cloud strategy, this is exactly what Google is doing. Google is open sourcing the best way that it knows how to build and run infrastructure software. This is happening slowly but steadily. To some extent, the other major providers including Amazon will have no choice but to follow Google into a battleground that was built by Google.</p><p>And as developers, we will get to reap all the rewards of this competition. Our infrastructure will become more standardized, more fault tolerant, cheaper, better designed, and easier to use. And who knows, maybe someday we will actually be able to easily move workloads from one cloud to another.</p><p>To the extent that I am a software engineering journalist, I feel inclined to scrutinize all of the cloud providers. But to the extent that I am an engineer and a business person, I feel only admiration and love for the cloud providers. Cloud computing has brought the cost of starting an Internet business down to zero.</p><p>Cloud computing has opened up my eyes to a world of creative possibilities that knows no boundaries, and for that I will always be a fan of all of the rivaling cloud companies because they all have played a role in creating the current software landscape.</p><p>Eric Brewer is a Google Fellow and VP Infrastructure. <a href="http://www.se-radio.net/2015/05/the-cap-theorem-then-and-now/">He is well-known for his work on the CAP theorem, a distributed systems concept that formalized the tradeoffs between consistency, availability, and partition tolerance in a distributed system.</a></p><p>At Google, Eric is as much a strategist and product creator as he is a theoretician. He has worked on database systems such as Spanner, machine learning systems such as TensorFlow, and container orchestration systems such as Kubernetes and GKE.</p><p>Eric joins the show to talk about Google’s philosophy as a cloud provider, and how his understanding of distributed systems has evolved since joining the company.</p>',

The most prominent feature of a PaaS is the ability to abstract away issues that every developer within an organization has to deal with. As an example, developers today don’t need to fear scalability and load balancing issues as much as engineers of the 90’s and early 2000s. We can develop our applications without worrying about the scaling that is going on under the covers.</p><p>Sinclair Schuller is the CEO of Apprenda and he joins the show today to discuss what is involved in building a PaaS, particularly one targeted at enterprises. His company was started in 2007, just a few years after AWS got started. </p><p>We also talked about the potential Docker Fork, for which Sinclair had useful business and engineering perspectives.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>JavaScript is everywhere, on the browser, the server, and now on hardware. Finally–the Internet of Things is upon us — and it is powered by JavaScript. Even if you consider yourself a web developer, and you have no interest in “maker” culture, keep your eye on this space. Factories in Shenzhen are making better, more modular parts, and the same supply chain economics that are driving down the cost of smart phones and smart cars, will give hobbyist engineers all the simple hardware components they could ever need. This will power a future of proliferated devices that have internet connectivity and “talk” to each other to enable user experiences we wouldn’t dream of today. And naturally, with this will come problems that we cannot anticipate as well.</p><p>On today’s episode, Andrew discusses how JavaScript can be used on hardware. Jeff and Andrew talk about the players in the hardware space, as well as how the big cloud players like AWS and Azure are positioning themselves to be the data lakes for the internet of things. Andrew is giving a talk about this at the <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/pub/cpc/5332">2016 O’Reilly Fluent Conference</a>.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>A data warehouse provides low latency access to large volumes of data. </p><p>A data warehouse is a crucial piece of infrastructure for a large company, because it can be used to answer complex questions involving a large number of data points. But a data warehouse usually cannot hold all of a company’s data at any given time. Users need to move a subset of the data into the data warehouse by reading large files from a data lake on disk and putting that data into the data warehouse.</p><p>The process of moving data from one place into another is broken down into three sequential steps, often called “ETL” (extract, transform, load) or “ELT” (extract, load, transform). In ETL, the data is extracted from a source such as a data lake, transformed into a schema that is customized for the data warehouse application, and then loaded into the data warehouse. In ELT, the last two steps are reversed, because modern systems can often leave the necessary schema transformation until after the data has been loaded into the data warehouse.</p><p>Matthew Scullion is the CEO of Matillion, a company that specializes in building tools for data transformations. Matthew joins the show to talk about the problem of data transformation, and how that problem has evolved over the nine years since he started Matillion.</p><p>If you enjoy the show, you can find all of our past episodes about data infrastructure by going to <a href="https://www.softwaredaily.com/">SoftwareDaily.com</a> and searching for the technologies or companies mentioned.

And when Slack was created, it quickly became a part of most software companies. But Slack does not fulfill the needs of every company.</p><p>Mattermost is an open-source chat system. Mattermost can be configured to work within enterprises that have strong constraints around compliance and data governance. Whereas Slack is a SaaS product that requires users to send their data to the cloud servers managed by Slack, Mattermost allows the enterprise to decide how data moves through services, and where the databases are hosted.</p><p>Ian Tien is the CEO of Mattermost, and he joins the show to talk about why many companies need their chat system to be hosted in a private cloud or on-premises. In a <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/12/17/mattermost-self-hosted-slack-alternative-with-corey-hulen/">previous episode with CTO Corey Hulen</a> we discussed the engineering behind the company. In today’s episode, we explore the management and strategy of the business, as well as some additional engineering, since Ian Tien’s background is as a software engineer and computer scientist.</p>',

An enterprise has sprawling infrastructure, with both on-prem and cloud infrastructure. Identity management systems, vulnerability scanning, secure network infrastructure, and policy management tools are just a few example areas where enterprises spend billions of dollars on security software.</p><p>Threats often make their way into an enterprise by way of social engineering. This can result in phishing attacks, corporate espionage, and ransomware. Protecting against social engineering is very difficult, as there are so many channels to communicate through–Facebook Messenger, Linkedin, email, and ad networks can all be used to perform social engineering attacks.</p><p>Enterprise security software is a very different business from other types of software companies.

Code Connect lets a developer immediately see what value a variable is taking, and provide test values to troubleshoot a portion of code to understand how different code paths are going to work. This is instead of having to compile and run the full program.</p><p>If you have ever thought about making developer tools for an IDE or a programming language, this episode provides some great information.</p>',

Although it still seems far away, self-driving cars are starting to feel like an inevitability. This is especially true if you spend much time in downtown San Francisco, where you will see a self-driving car being tested every day. Much of the time, that self-driving car will be operated by Cruise.</p><p>Cruise is a company that is building a self-driving car service. The company has hundreds of engineers working across the stack, from computer vision algorithms to automotive hardware. Cruise’s engineering requires engineers who can work with cloud tools as well as low-latency devices. It also requires product developers and managers to lead these different teams.</p><p>The field of self-driving is very new. There is not much literature available on how to build a self-driving car. There is even less literature on how to manage a team of engineers that are building, testing, and deploying software and hardware for real cars that are driving around the streets of San Francisco.</p><p>Mo Elshenawy is VP of engineering at Cruise, and he joins the show to talk about the engineering that is required to develop fully self-driving car technology, as well as how to structure teams to align the roles of product design, software engineering, testing, machine learning, and hardware. </p><p>Full disclosure: Cruise is a sponsor of Software Engineering Daily.</p>',

If you are the mobile application developer building the food delivery app, what other choice do you have?</p><p>At large companies such as Linkedin, there are entire teams devoted to figuring out how to optimize the notifications that they send you. It has a surprisingly large impact on the usability of a mobile application. Troy Goode is the founder of Courier, a company that provides notification optimization.</p><p>This might sound like a small, trivial problem. But it actually has a large impact on the usage of apps.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>If the Internet was reimagined with the software and hardware infrastructure we have today, what would it look like?</p><p>That is the question that DFINITY is working on answering. DFINITY’s goal is to build a decentralized, secure Internet computer. DFINITY takes concepts from the cryptocurrency world, but it is focused on computation, not financial products. DFINITY can be thought of as a decentralized cloud provider, with redundancy and scalability properties that are achieved by operating on data centers across the world.</p><p>DFINITY wants to host web applications such as the ones that we use today on centralized servers. A developer who wants to run their application on DFINITY compiles their code to WebAssembly and deploys it to the DFINITY decentralized runtime. Transactions across DFINITY applications are processed through a collateralized proof-of-stake system to ensure reliable, decentralized computation.</p><p>DFINITY is an ambitious project, and it would seem nearly impossible to bring to market if not for the quality of the team. DFINITY has hired Andreas Rossburg, a co-designer of WebAssembly, as well as talented engineers across security, web development, and backend infrastructure.</p><p>Dominic Williams is the president and chief scientist of DFINITY, and he joins the show to talk about the vision for DFINITY and the roadmap to making it a reality.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>A cryptocurrency has a distributed ledger called a blockchain. The blockchain keeps track of every transaction that occurs across the cryptocurrency. This blockchain must stay up-to-date and verified–which requires someone in the network to do that validation.</p><p>Bitcoin and Ethereum use the proof-of-work algorithm. Miners do computational work to validate the legitimacy of transactions across the network, and in return they are given cryptocurrency as a reward for that computational work.</p><p>In the future, cryptocurrencies could move towards a proof-of-stake model. If you own a significant amount of cryptocurrency, you have incentive to keep the validity of the blockchain up to date. Proof-of-stake algorithms can be significantly less energy intensive.</p><p>Vlad Zamfir is a researcher for the Ethereum Foundation, and he joins Haseeb Qureshi for a conversation about cryptoeconomics.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Most episodes of Software Engineering Daily are interviews with an expert about a technical software concept. Occasionally I write editorials, and also record them as a podcast.</p><p>The first editorial was about <a href="http://softwaredaily.wpengine.com/2016/02/12/10-philosophies-for-developers/">10 Philosophies for Engineers</a>, the second was about <a href="http://softwaredaily.wpengine.com/2016/04/02/poker-software-engineering/">how poker relates to software engineering</a>, and the third was about <a href="http://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2016/06/11/music/">music and software engineering</a>.</p><p>Today’s episode is called “You Are Not A Commodity”.</p><p>Since it is a departure from the normal format, I am releasing it on a weekend, and there are no ads on this episode. If you don’t like this episode — don’t worry. On Monday, Software Engineering Daily will be back to the usual highly technical rigor. In any case — please send your feedback on Twitter or email.</p><p>You Are Not A Commodity</p><p>Software engineers are often trapped in careers that consist entirely of software maintenance rather than building new products.</p><p>This post:</p><p>During the industrial revolution people began working on assembly lines.</p><p>At the assembly line, workers were given narrow roles. The assembly line is a resilient, consistent tool for manufacturing because the roles of each worker are so well defined that the worker can be easily replaced.</p><p>Assembly line workers are so easily replaced as to effectively be a commodity — a raw good to be bought and used up.</p><p>For the worker, becoming a commodity was unpleasant. But there were not good alternatives to working on an assembly line. You could not simply quit the assembly line and go start your own.</p><p><br>\nIndividual workers suffered, but society progressed quickly because industrialists could leverage the commodity workers to have more predictable output.</p><p>This method of production continued into the the information age.</p><p>Early computer systems were hard to operate. Individuals did not have much leverage. Teams of people needed to be closely managed to accomplish significant tasks.</p><p>Today, computer systems are easier to operate. Individual engineers can build lifestyle businesses. Small teams can build products as big as WhatsApp. Everyone has more leverage — not just industrialists who are in charge of assembly lines.</p><p>Most software engineers take a career path that gives them as much leverage as the commodity workers of the assembly line. We conform ourselves to the unpleasant tasks that are needed by large corporations.</p><p>Why should I care? Is this bad?</p><p>If you take one thing away from this post, make it the following: <strong>it is now easy to build your own assembly line.</strong></p><p>The economics of the big company do not reward the lower level workers. Today, it is easy for a skilled engineer to opt out of the poorly compensating corporate machinery.</p><p>20 years ago, the tools within a large software corporation were much more sophisticated than anything you could buy as an individual.</p><p>Then Amazon Web Services reduced the cost of server provisioning and management from $50,000 for a machine to essentially free.</p><p>The excellent free infrastructure provided by AWS led to excellent free software like Dropbox, Trello, and Slack. These cheap tools integrate with each other and empower the individual to be massively productive.</p><p>SaaS tools get combined with each other and built into even better tools. The quality of available software compounds at a staggering rate.</p><p>Cloud computing triggered such a massive improvement in public software that individuals and small teams can build a tech stack that often works more effectively than that of a big corporation.</p><p>Big corporations are tightly coupled to their tools, and cannot take advantage of this rapidly compounding software quality. Outside of a big corporation, you are free to mix and match tools as you see fit.</p><p>Software tools are the means of production, the equivalent of the assembly lines of 1900s industrialists, and access to these means of production have become decentralized.</p><p>In fact, the entire economy has become decentralized.</p><p>Not just means of production but <a href="https://services.amazon.com/fulfillment-by-amazon/benefits.htm">distribution</a>, <a href="http://fiverr.com">contracting</a>, <a href="http://stripe.com">payments</a>, <a href="http://quora.com">access to domain expertise</a>, and every other aspect of business. The advantages of big centralized corporations are now available to individuals and small teams.</p><p>Fiverr is one example of a service provider that an individual or small team can use for leverage. Fiverr contractors can provide cheap help with accounting, WordPress, audio and video editing, marketing, and other supplementary work that big companies hire full-time employees to do.</p><p>A large corporation needs recruiters and hiring managers employed to vet potential employees. Instead of the time-consuming interview process, Fiverr’s reputation system means that the work of candidates speaks for itself. Interviewing is a formality.</p><p><br>\nFiverr is useful for tasks that are not complicated, but require focus and consistency. Upwork, a similar service, can be used for more complex tasks, like software development. These services fulfill the dream that was believed about offshoring software development in the 1990’s — high quality, cheap outsourcing.</p><p>Fiverr and Upwork put downward pressure on the cost of contractors, but software businesses also need full-time workers. Building a full-time engineering workforce has also become cheaper.</p><p>This sounds counterintuitive to anyone who has heard of the “peak talent war” of tech, but each individual engineer has so much leverage today that you need dramatically fewer engineers to ship good software. You also don’t need to pay for real estate to house those engineers.</p><p>In the past, a team of software engineers needed a physical place to work together in. That is no longer the case. Docker, TopTal, and Hashicorp are among the companies that have moved to remote work, enabled by Slack and other collaboration tools.</p><p>Remote companies report increased transparency and improved communication. Remote employees must leave a trail of finished work to let themselves be audited — which is not difficult for employees who are actually getting work done. Chat logs and github commits do not lie.</p><p>At a large company, engineering productivity is reduced by having to interface with project managers and business development people.</p><p>Small companies benefit from the fact that engineers have to understand the big picture — business, design, sales, and product development. Engineering manager Fred George’s concept of <a href="https://martinjeeblog.com/2012/11/20/what-is-programmer-anarchy-and-does-it-have-a-future/"><em>Programmer Anarchy</em></a> takes this to the extreme.</p><p>The success of Programmer Anarchy indicates higher leverage among engineers. The role of engineer can subsume all other roles.</p><p>Programmer Anarchy works today because the tools are better and the practice of software engineering is more widely understood. Engineers don’t have to spend as much time writing boilerplate code, so the leftover time can be spent thinking about the product at a higher level — which yields business value.</p><p><br>\nUnderstand this: the leverage of the individual engineer is big — much bigger than it has ever been. The leverage of the small team is massive.</p><p>If you are building a business alone or with a small team, the classic advice is to “<a href="http://paulgraham.com/good.html">make something people want</a>” or “<a href="http://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html">live in the future and build what seems interesting</a>”.</p><p>This is good advice for the brainstorming phase of building products, but many engineers have never built a prototype. Engineers who have done maintenance for their whole career can’t imagine how to go from an idea to a usable product.</p><p>If you have spent most of your career at a large corporation, you might be handicapped by a reliance on internal tooling and workflows. If you want to build a product end-to-end, you have to devote some time to getting decent at every area of the stack.</p><p>You have to learn to prototype, which means building new programs from nothing. This is more of an emotional and psychological journey than a technical challenge.</p><p>We all remember the pleasure of building software from scratch, whether it was a simple game or a calculator app. Why do we ever stop building new stuff? Because our corporate software jobs normalize the idea of software maintenance.</p><p>If you have just escaped a corporate job, you can start with 1–2 months of re-skilling. You probably have some money saved up, and it might even be worth going through a coding boot camp.</p><p>Boot camps like Hack Reactor are renowned for their ability to instill engineers with the skills and the necessary workflows to build projects alone.</p><p>Even if you have a computer science degree, there is no shame in going to a coding boot camp. Universities teach theory, boot camps teach execution.</p><p>Whether you attend a boot camp or lock yourself in your apartment with a Pluralsight subscription, the re-skilling process can iron out the sad past life of the software maintenance engineer, allowing for a rediscovery of the creative joy that probably made you fall in love with programming in the first place.</p><p>This means getting away from the thick, industrial languages like Java and C#, and going deep on a set of tools that allow for rapid prototyping, like React and NodeJS or Ruby on Rails.</p><p>An engineer who is interested in data science and machine learning can spend time learning TensorFlow or Spark — there are countless tutorials online.</p><p><br>\nBuilding an entire prototype and deploying it to Digital Ocean or Heroku is a satisfying experience — especially after spending several years on the software assembly line, understanding only small parts of an application.</p><p>The first time you type in the URL of a webapp that you built and deployed entirely yourself will provide a rush that no six-figure programming job can provide.</p><p>With enough practice, building your own software becomes easy. The challenge then becomes <em>what</em> to build.</p><p>After acquiring fresh skills and learning to prototype, it is easier to dream up new product ideas without the self-doubt that you won’t be able to bring such a product to market.</p><p>Once you have the requisite skills to build a software product, what do you build?</p><p>Much has been written about the brainstorming process. Paul Graham essays and books like The Lean Startup are useful guides to thinking up an idea for software that generates money.</p><p>After spending a long time in a large corporation, your ability to think up fresh ideas might have become weak. As a programmer trying to think up new ideas, it is easy to become discouraged and think that everything has been invented already.</p><p>One strategy for overcoming this mental atrophy is to look at the giant markets that would be too big to capture even if all of the programmers in the world pursued them at once.</p><p>“Machine learning + X” is one of the safest routes to take if you are building a software business and don’t know where to begin. As futurist Kevin Kelly says, <em>“The business plans of the next 10,000 startups are easy to forecast: Take X and add AI.”</em></p><p>Every business needs machine learning applications in the same way that every business needed a web site in the 90’s. At the same time, most developers are afraid of machine learning because it sounds intimidating.</p><p>When developers try out the available machine learning tools, they find scikit-learn to be as accommodating as Ruby on Rails is for web development.</p><p>Even if you build a machine learning product that nobody needs, you will have to learn machine learning in order to do that. If your first product fails, you might be able to reuse some of the code in your next machine learning product.</p><p>Hardware is another field with wide opportunity. Like machine learning, hardware also sounds harder than it is (“hard” is even in the name).</p><p>Just as Spark and scikit-learn are simplifying machine learning, cheap hardware like Tessel and friendly software frameworks like Johnny-Five are simplifying hardware prototyping.</p><p>IoT is the place to start for new hardware developers. Every major cloud provider and chip producer is investing heavily in IoT. Since giant companies are competing to provide the best IoT platform, individual developers can take advantage of that competition.</p><p>For the developer, everything is cheap. Companies like GE, Amazon, and Microsoft are fighting to capture market share, and they are willing to lose plenty of money bringing developers onto their platform.</p><p>Common customers for IoT products are factories, farms, warehouses, and other industrial businesses. These sectors also have huge piles of money to spend, and they are becoming more tech-savvy and willing to experiment with new hardware.</p><p>Regardless of what product you build, every enterprising software engineer should keep in mind one fundamental trend: <strong>the biggest pair of economic forces working in your favor are cloud computing on the supply side and small devices on the demand side</strong>.</p><p>Small devices like mobile phones and IoT need new, unique applications. Customers will pay money for these. Cloud computing means that providing those applications to the end user is cheap.</p><p>This trend will impact whatever area of technology you decide to work on in some way.</p><p>In developing countries, the demand for unique smartphone apps is even more acute than it is in the developed world because consumers in developing countries often do not have a laptop or desktop computer. The only computer they have is a smart phone.</p><p>Today, many developing countries have poor connectivity, which makes the demands of consumers different from developed countries. These places are less saturated with technologists, so they are ripe for people looking to study the local markets and understand the pain points of consumers.</p><p>There are plenty of other burgeoning sectors — the gig economy, virtual reality, Docker, cryptocurrencies. After studying any one of these sectors in detail, it becomes clear how much technological growth can be realized in the next few years, and how few people are putting themselves in a position to capture it.</p><p>The hardest battle to fight here is understanding that you should build <em>something</em>. Once you internalize that fact and acquire the necessary skills to prototype, the process of building is a fun exploration, even if you fail along the way.</p><p>Now that we have discussed how to build an assembly line, let’s address some counterarguments that favor being a commodity employee of a large corporation.</p><p><strong><em>The compensation counterargument</em>: corporations pay lots of money</strong></p><p><br>\nThe average employee realizes a small fraction of the value created by her work.</p><p>Most of the money goes to the people who created the assembly line, not the people who maintain it and build on top of it. Clearly, individuals who create an assembly line are rewarded more handsomely.</p><p><strong><em>The loyalty counterargument: </em>someone has to do this work!</strong></p><p>Employees often feel a sense of guilt when they leave a large company. Their work is so important to the company’s health — how will the company run without it?</p><p>If your work is so important to the company, that probably means you could go to your manager right now and ask for the biggest raise that is justifiable given the revenue generated by your work. If they don’t give you the raise, that means they won’t have trouble replacing you.</p><p>If the company <em>does</em> give you a raise, that implies that the company could have calculated that your work was more important than your compensation implied — in which case the company was deliberately paying you less than it could afford. This doesn’t sound like a relationship where “loyalty” should play a major role in our career calculus.</p><p>Your relationship to a big company is firstly transactional. The company <em>needs</em> to pay you the minimum and extract the maximum. There is room for feelings of loyalty only at the margins of this relationship.</p><p><strong><em>The stability counterargument: </em>large corporations are safe</strong></p><p>Corporations present a career ladder that can appeal to a student who progressed comfortably through the linear path of high school and college, where success was simple to plot.</p><p>This straight path seems quite comfortable. Do the work you are assigned and you will naturally rise through the ranks. In the average case, life is good!</p><p>The average case <em>always</em> looks good for strong engineer.<em> </em>If you are a good engineer, your downside risk is capped in most conceivable futures.</p><p>It is almost impossible to imagine a world in which engineers are not in high demand. In the hypothetical scenario where a good engineer is <em>not </em>employable, it is likely that something will have gone drastically wrong with the economy.</p><p>This fact negates the idea that patiently saving for the future is “safe”. Which financial instrument could you keep your money in that would insulate that money from a total economic collapse? Even if you have $200,000 in guns, gold, and bitcoin, will you even have the self-sufficiency to know how to properly manage those assets in a time of economic collapse?</p><p>Assuming the world economy continues the way it is going, the path of the corporate ladder is much riskier than starting something on your own. If you start something on your own and fail, you can always return to a large corporation, probably with improved skills.</p><p>The safer investment is to train yourself with the ability to invent and be independent.</p><p><strong><em>The leverage counterargument: </em>corporate infrastructure empowers me</strong></p><p><br>\nInnovations made by internal employees</p><p>Google, Amazon, and Facebook retain their best employees by giving them freedom to invent. The employees who built AWS, or the Like button, or the HoloLens escaped their commodity status by building something that differentiated them so much as to become a lynchpin within the company.</p><p>Inventing from within a large organization is the perfect strategy for someone who is stuck at a company on an H1-B, or who is working off student load debt, or who has a family situation that prevents them from quitting their job.</p><p>If you aren’t restricted by immigration constraints or financial constraints, you have much more to gain by building something on your own outside of a company. It raises the stakes and forces you to overcome your fears.</p><p>When you invent a product on your own, the best case scenario is quite appealing. You get to capture 100% of the product’s value and you maintain complete creative control. Neither of these are guaranteed when inventing at a big company.</p><p><strong><em>The mentorship counterargument: </em>a corporation is a great place to learn</strong></p><p>Corporations can be a great place to learn how to do highly structured work. You are assigned tasks, you learn how to use tools like git, you learn how to sit through meetings and talk to co-workers.</p><p>Reviewing code from other co-workers can be educational, and teach you how to improve the efficiency and readability of your own code. The corporation will impose reasonably high standards on your work.</p><p>The problem with “mentorship” at a big corporation is that it brainwashes you in the same ways that it has brainwashed the people who will be your mentors.</p><p>As an inexperienced employee, your work is likely to be centered around software maintenance. The company will pitch it to you as fresh and exciting because they see you as naive. But you won’t be building a new product where you have creative control and true responsibility.</p><p><strong>The hardest part of building a new product is deciding that you are going to build a new product, and following through with that decision.</strong> Corporate mentorship is not going to focus on this.</p><p>If your long-term goal is to build new products, avoid the farce of corporate mentorship. If your goal is a career of software maintenance, then commence the brainwashing.</p><p>Building new software is the perfect activity for someone who likes art, science, business, or adrenaline.</p><p>Other activities that provide a similar emotional high include drugs, video games, sex, gambling, browsing Facebook, writing music, painting a picture, international diplomacy, raising children, and skydiving.</p><p>Humans get habituated to most of these activities and have to constantly raise the stakes. We need to gamble for more money. We need more intense drugs and more immersive video games.</p><p>When we build software companies, the stakes automatically get raised over time. As users grow, our financial swings get bigger. Users who love the products we build give us praise that is more meaningful than the Likes and comments on Facebook. And the intellectual challenge is constantly morphing and presenting new problems to solve.</p><p>Inventing new software is sustainable, rewarding, and fun. It is an adventure!</p><p>Many engineers work a job where they feel like a replaceable commodity. They spend several hours a day pondering their existence and doubting their self-worth. Escape this trap — build something!</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Moat is one of the most successful advertising technology companies in history. After building a business from measurement of ad impressions, Moat was sold to Oracle for $850 million.</p><p>Advertising powers the free content on the Internet. Measurement makes it easier for publishers to monetize their content. At Software Engineering Daily, we know this from firsthand experience. The podcast ecosystem has barely any ability to measure success–and that can make it hard to entice advertisers. In podcasting, it is very difficult to understand if an advertising campaign is a success.</p><p>This illustrates why Moat is important. Improving the analytics on advertising helps publishers, brands, ad agencies, and adtech companies decide how to allocate their capital. </p><p>Why is it hard to measure advertising success? Why is this a difficult engineering problem? Because there are so many players in the space with conflicting incentives. </p><p>A brand wants to show ads to people who will buy a product. A publisher wants to display an ad that will maximize revenue. Adtech companies and ad agencies want to take the biggest cut possible from the transactions between brands and publishers. In the midst of all of this, fraudulent traffic providers offer cheap services that drain money from anyone who is not keeping a close eye on their deal flow.</p><p>In this fog of war, Moat’s goal is to provide transparency where possible. Moat CEO Jonah Goodhart joins this episode to talk about advertising analytics, viewability, and fraud. </p><p>If you like this episode, we have done many other shows about adtech and advertising fraud.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Most episodes of Software Engineering Daily are interviews with an expert about a technical software concept. Over the past year I have done a few experiments that are more editorial in nature, and both were very popular. The first editorial was about <a href="http://softwaredaily.wpengine.com/2016/02/12/10-philosophies-for-developers/">10 Philosophies for Engineers</a>, and the second was about <a href="http://softwaredaily.wpengine.com/2016/04/02/poker-software-engineering/">how poker relates to software engineering</a>.</p><p>Today’s episode is an editorial about the creative process of writing computer music, and how it relates to software engineering.</p><p>Since it is a departure from the normal format, I am releasing it on a weekend, and there are no ads on this episode. If you don’t like this episode — don’t worry. On Monday, Software Engineering Daily will be back to the usual highly technical rigor. In any case — please send your feedback on Twitter or email.</p><p>A year ago, I was working at Amazon as a software engineer. Much of my spare time was spent writing music on the computer. I would wake up at 6 AM, work on music for three hours, and then walk to work through downtown Seattle.</p><p>The great tragedy of working at any giant tech company is that most employees are completing menial tasks that make the company millions of dollars and make the employee a small fraction of that financial windfall.</p><p>In the past, these economics made sense for the employee. The employer used to be a source of leverage for talented workers. Today, our tools are so cheap and powerful that we can succeed on our own, without a giant corporation. Unfortunately, this is such a recent development that most employees remain trapped within the story of corporatism. Employees dutifully believe that the corporation is doing them a favor.</p><p>The last song I wrote while I was at Amazon is called <em>Zeroes</em>. It is about people who are not aware of the fact that they have much more power than corporations want them to believe.</p><p>Writing music is similar to writing software. The digital audio workstations that music producers use are similar to IDEs that we use to step through a debugger, or detect errors in code. Just as an IDE will help you organize your code and manage your abstractions, a digital audio workstation can be used to coordinate instruments. The workstation can tell you what keys to play in what order, so you don’t need to know anything about music theory.</p><p>Despite all of this help, the music software still doesn’t write the song for you. Much like the human-machine teams that currently dominate competitive chess, the best music today comes from the musicians who are best able to work in harmony with the most sophisticated technology. This has always been the case — from The Beatles to Max Martin to Skrillex.</p><p>What the human brings to the table in human-machine music creation is an understanding of contemporary tastes. This is why I listen to pop music. Top 40 radio stations and Spotify playlists are not perfectly democratic, but they are close enough. I pay attention to the trends of the most popular music, and try to replicate them.</p><p>This next song was written because I was copying the bass lines that became popular from <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwijxKOA-KDNAhVD22MKHSroBxIQyCkIHzAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DO-zpOMYRi0w&amp;usg=AFQjCNHUEOfblHzIg3E1jVTF8o3pDT5KQw&amp;sig2=q0oiyiTU4TVBwiWh2776Tw&amp;bvm=bv.124272578,d.cGc">the Iggy Azalea song <em>Fancy</em></a>, which was #1 for seven weeks straight in the Summer of 2014. Even after trying to copy the bass line, I ended up with a very different song than <em>Fancy.</em></p><p>Open source allows software quality levels to reach new heights. With open source, new software builds compounding interest on previously written software. The software spreads and replicates freely around the internet thanks to open repositories that new users can pull from.</p><p>In music, this easy replication of information has led to a sampling revolution. Sampling is the act of cutting a snippet of sound from a song, or a TV show, or simply any random noise that you find interesting, and turning that snippet of sound into its own instrument.</p><p>In 2009, I was studying hip hop production techniques. On uTorrent, I found a download of hip hop acapellas — samples of rappers rapping without instrumentals. I stitched some of these acapellas together and made a lyrical sample with 50 Cent, Eminem, and Nas. Underneath that vocal, I sliced up a sample from 24-Carat Black, a soul and funk band from 1970s that has been sampled by lots of hip hop artists.</p><p>As a warning to sensitive listeners, these lyrics contain some harsh and sexist language, and do not represent my views as a podcaster.</p><p>This next song is called Chicago, written when I was in Chicago at my first job out of college. The creation of that song was driven more by raw emotion than a logical approach, or a specific musical concept.</p><p>I was working as a software engineer at an options trading company called PEAK6. The people at the company had fascinating, extreme personalities and brutal honesty was encouraged more than anywhere else I have worked.</p><p>At PEAK6, building options trading software that could directly translate into profits for the company, I also had the feeling that if I did something important that made the company a lot of money, I would be compensated fairly. In this sense, a trading company can be more of a meritocracy than other tech companies.</p><p>Working at a trading company, if you build a software feature for the traders in your company, you can walk over to the traders and ask them how much money it is making them. If they say it has increased their profits by 10%, it is very straightforward to ask your boss for a raise of at LEAST 10%. In contrast, at most tech companies, if you build a tool that improves productivity for your coworkers or your customers, it is often harder to quantify whether you deserve a raise based on building that software. Furthermore, at big tech companies there is so much office politics, and so many rules of propriety and servility and respect of your superiors — if you do something that you think is impressive, but it doesn’t positively impact your manager, that action might actually have negative consequences for you as an employee.</p><p>On the trading floor, the atmosphere of healthy debate, brutal honesty, and lots of money flying around reminded me of <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-to-earn-a-living-through-poker/answer/Jeff-Meyerson?srid=po1Y">my roots as a poker player</a>, and in that sense I felt at home. In college, I was so obsessed with the intersection of finance and technology that I wrote <a href="http://jeffmeyerson.com/tag/lunar-market">a piece of fiction</a> about an artificial intelligence that gets built at a hedge fund. The AI gets so smart that it eventually divests itself from the hedge fund and starts its own company, calling itself simply “Bank”.</p><p>This next song is about that financial AI that awakens within the hedge fund — the song is called BANK.</p><p>Most software engineers have written a game at some point in their career. I spent much of my time in college thinking about games that reflected the absurd financial fluctuations that I experienced as a poker player. The greatest games provide the player with a sense of drama. A game should be designed to be able to turn your stomach or fill you with elation and adrenaline.</p><p>One game I worked on in college with a few friends is called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jeffmeyerson.moonstocks&amp;hl=en">MoonStocks</a>. I built it with a few friends — Josh Stewart and Pong Tam — in this game, you can buy and sell fictional stocks that fluctuate in price based on Fourier transforms of songs I wrote. On the Android Play Store, you can download MoonStocks if you are interested.</p><p>MoonStocks gave me great pleasure, because it allowed me to combine my niche interests of games, finance, music, storytelling, and programming. This is a lesson in creativity that is preached often these days in our long-tail economy: if you can’t be a 10,000 hour master of one specific thing, try to master the intersection of a few niche topics. The more unusual the topics that you pursue, the greater a chance you have at developing a deeper understanding than anyone else.</p><p>Another game I built in college was called “<a href="https://github.com/crablar/RatMarket">RatMarket</a>”. The setting of the game is a post-apocalyptic world where the only organisms left are rats and humans. Rat meat has become the only commodity that is traded in the world, and human arbitrageurs create bizarre financial instruments out of the rat meat commodity trading market. This was yet another dead-end project, but after working on it for awhile, I was so engrossed that I wrote a song based on it. So I hope you enjoy this next song, “RatMarket”.</p><p>Absurdity is at the heart of the projects I work on. Playing with absurd concepts lets you stay unpredictable as a creator. When you combine absurdity with a relentless work ethic, you end up exploring more ideas with more tenacity than anyone else. People who respond to absurdity with shame and condemnation are repressed. They have never discovered the utility of the absurd because they have never experimented outside of local maxima of what makes sense.</p><p>This is not to say that absurdity should be adopted as a way of life. Absurdity taken too far is embarrassing and unproductive. A pleasant, intellectual conversation with a hint of absurd humor can be ruined by a sarcastic person, a drunk, or a stoner who takes the absurdity too far.</p><p>Absurdity is a tool to explore the edges of what has not been clearly delineated by science and reason. It is with a taste for the absurd that Airbnb was dreamed up. I’ve seen enough videos of Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky telling the Airbnb story to know that absurdity is deeply ingrained in the DNA of the company. How else would you come to the conclusion that having strangers sleeping on air beds in your apartment would be a billion dollar business? Not to mention <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/how-a-box-of-cereal-and-being-like-a-cockroach-helped-airbnb-become-a-billion-dollar-business-2013-3">the cereal box fundraising story</a>.</p><p>When I try to reason about how intelligent machines will think about the world, my sense of logic fails me. When we are speculating about how machines will think, we instinctively turn to the way that humans think, and try to imagine robot cognition relative to the human model of cognition. This is almost certainly wrong. But still, this topic inevitably comes up in conversation.</p><p>Vacillating between the ideas of the serious, and the absurd, the next two songs explore two sides of how I speculate about the evolving artificial intelligence. The first song is simply called <em>Robots</em>, and it represents the absurdly alien sense of how robots might come online with self-awareness. The second song, <em>Roger the Robot Janitor</em>, explores the human-relativistic view of how robots might think to themselves.</p><p><em>Roger the Robot Janitor</em> is more about humans than it is about robots. Most of us have had a job that we don’t like. Roger has been designed with cutting edge artificial intelligence technology, and his job is to clean toilets at an elementary school.</p><p>If you are a well-educated American listening to this, you were probably raised with the belief that you could do anything. You jumped through all of the right hoops, you went to college, you got a high paying job. And yet, somewhere along the way, the ideals that you felt growing up turned into a desperation in the pit of your stomach. It seems like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Something_Happened"><em>something happened </em></a>along the way and you are no longer looking at the world as an opportunity, but as something to insulate yourself from and relentlessly hedge against.</p><p>It is an all-American seduction that many of the best and brightest computer scientists are seduced from college into crappy, dead-end jobs at giant software companies. They are dead end jobs because they seduce you into a mindset that is not true. The mindset is that you need a giant corporation to survive, and that it is noble and validating to go work at a job with minimal creativity and maximal servility.</p><p>In this sense, we are all Roger the Robot Janitor. We have all woken up to realize we have been programmed with the peculiar desire to keep ourselves from doing anything substantial, for fear of disrupting the safe but blase life that we have established for ourselves.</p><p>If you have had this realization, you have either suppressed it, or experienced a dramatic internal transformation. Or — if you are like me when I was at Amazon — you are experiencing cognitive dissonance. You are suppressing yourself from acting out because you are in preparation mode. You are preparing to escape your cloistered environment, saving up money and willpower.</p><p>You are on the Career Track, but soon you will be on your own. And there is great drama in this moment.</p><p>In the Summer of 2010, the cassette-to-iPod connecting cable in my car broke, and I could no longer play podcasts and music while I was in the car. On the commute to and from my Summer internship, I had an hour and a half of time driving. So I started listening to radio, and during this time I discovered the beauty of contemporary pop music.</p><p>The melodies in pop music are extremely simple, and this makes songwriting extremely simple. In software engineering, when you have the simplest abstractions, programming is exhilarating. Studying pop music was like studying functional programming — the abstractions make creativity unexpectedly easy. Also, both pop music and functional programming have rabid fan bases.</p><p>In order to fully adopt the mindset of a pop musician, I had to write a song about love and relationships and heartbreak, because almost every pop song is about romance. During this time, I was becoming so obsessed with pop music that I decided at some point I was going to become a pop music producer. With this in mind, I needed to learn to collaborate, so I convinced my friend Genevieve to sing what I wrote. The song is called “Letdown”.</p><p>At this point, I have talked through an hour’s worth of songs. This topic is too self-indulgent and far removed from the core idea of Software Engineering Daily to go much further today, but if you listened this far I sincerely thank you.</p><p>I always want to know what you think of this show. Send me an email at <a href="mailto:softwareengineeringdaily@gmail.com">softwareengineeringdaily@gmail.com</a>, or tweet at me. It is a huge privilege to have people who listen to this show — so let me know what <em>you</em> want to hear about.</p><p>I’m going to close with a song that I wrote for my cat Scout. The song is called <em>Scout.</em> Thanks again for listening.</p>',

When a process is malfunctioning in Erlang, the philosophy of the language is to let the process crash–and in a distributed system where unexpected faults happen on a regular basis, this philosophy of “let it crash” simplifies how we reason about an Erlang system. </p><p>Other distributed systems advantages of Erlang include the garbage collection strategy. Each process in Erlang has its own garbage collector which means makes it easier to construct systems without a stop-the-world garbage collection.</p><p>Francesco Cesarini is the founder of Erlang Solutions, and he joins the show today to discuss the book that he wrote with Steve Vinoski, called Designing for Scalability with Erlang/OTP.</p>',

Critics call this a violation of net neutrality and argue that it betrays what the internet stands for – openness and fair access to all destinations. This episodes jumps into the nuances of the debate, with Jeff playing counterpoint to the EFF’s stance – that Internet.org is not the internet.</p><p>Jeremy Malcolm is a technologist and lawyer who works for EFF’s international team on issues such as intellectual property, network neutrality, Internet governance, and trade.</p>',

In previous episodes of Software Engineering Daily, we have explained, how advertising fraud works, why it is absurd and disgraceful, and why nobody talks about.</p><p>We also cover ad fraud because I personally find it interesting and sometimes hilarious. Those are the same reasons I invited Shailin Dhar to speak at the third Software Engineering Daily Meetup. Shailin has been on the show twice before and he will be on again in the future.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Augmented reality applications are slowly making their way into the world of the consumer. Pokemon Go created the magical experience of seeing Pokemon superimposed upon the real world. IKEA’s mobile app lets you see how a couch would fit into your living room, which has a significant improvement on the furniture buying process.</p><p>Augmented reality applications can have even more dramatic impact on industrial enterprises.</p><p>Have you ever set up a factory? You might need to build a conveyor belt. You might need to put together the parts of a giant machine that extrudes steel. You might need to fix a silicon wafer fabrication machine. It takes an expert to set up these heavy, complicated machines. </p><p>ScopeAR is a company that builds augmented reality tools. One of the ScopeAR products allows users to telepresence with each other to collaborate on the construction and maintenance of heavy machinery. </p><p>Imagine I am setting up my factory, and I have a complicated piece of machinery (let’s say a conveyor belt) in front of me. I have never constructed a conveyor belt before. I put on a HoloLens, and set up a VoIP call with an expert who has experience with that piece of machinery, and they point out what I need to do by superimposing 3-D arrows, text, and other instructions on my field of vision. They can share my experience and help guide me through the process.</p><p>This is such a flexible tool–you can imagine applications for augmented reality assistance being useful in medicine, construction, education and other fields. </p><p>Scott Montgomerie is the CEO of ScopeAR and in today’s episode, we talk about the state of AR, how the AR tools from Apple and Google compare, and how the similarity between tools used for mapping the world in AR relate to the tools used to map the world by autonomous cars.</p><p>Scott was a great guest, and I hope to have him back on in the future.</p><p>We have done some great shows about how to build augmented reality and virtual reality applications.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Data streams about the weather can be used to predict how soybean futures are going to change in price. Satellite data streams can take pictures of the number of cars on the road, and judge how traffic patterns are changing. Search engines can aggregate data from different queries and determine what people are most interested in.</p><p>Data streams define how the world is changing over time. Technology companies process these data streams and make decisions based on that stream. The most direct example of this might be financial trading companies, which use all kinds of data streams to predict economic price changes.</p><p>When Henri Pihkala worked on algorithmic trading systems, he saw how useful these data streams are, and decided to build products around data streaming. Eventually, Henri started working on Streamr, a platform for data streams to be bought and sold on top of the Ethereum network.</p><p>Streamr is an adaptation of technology that Henri worked on before he started working on the decentralized version. The original technology is a user interface for connecting data streams and building applications on top of them, and he acquired several customers for that platform. Today, the Streamr platform is still mostly centralized, but Henri and his team are working on building out the decentralized infrastructure.</p><p>Streamr raised an ICO worth ~25 million Euros. Most startups would not raise this amount of money before series B, much less before they have a product with a large user base. In this episode, Henri discusses why they raised so much money, and explains why ICOs are different than equity raises. The investors who participated in the Streamr ICO received the DATAcoin token. Henri also explained why it makes sense for this ecosystem to have its own token.</p><p>Transcript provided by We Edit Podcasts.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Observability allows engineers to understand what is going on inside their systems. In its most raw form, observability comes from log data. Modern systems have many layers of logs–virtualized cloud infrastructure, container orchestration, the container runtime itself, and the application logic running within the container.</p><p>With all of these layers, it is not practical for a developer to have to sift through layers of logs every time a bug occurs in production, or a deployment fails integration tests. Higher level observability tools include charts, distributed tracing tools, and monitoring services. With proper observability, developers can save time during incident response. Day-to-day software development becomes safer and more comfortable.</p><p>Stripe is a payments company for developers. This episode is the first in a series of episodes profiling different aspects of the company. Our guest Cory Watson leads the observability team at Stripe. In subsequent episodes, we will explore infrastructure and machine learning at Stripe.</p><p>Throughout these episodes, you will get a sense for how Stripe’s engineering culture works.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>We sign many different types of contracts throughout our lives. We sign a mortgage to get a loan for a house. When we go to the hospital, we sign a piece of paper that defines how our medical data can be shared between organizations. These pieces of paper represent our opting into an agreement that will be mediated and enforced by computer interactions. We can’t see the code behind those computer interactions, and we can’t verify that it is abiding by the contract we agreed to.</p><p>Smart contracts allow for programmatic execution of contractual agreements. Code is law, and there is less ambiguity. The most widely used smart contract platform is the Ethereum blockchain–but several large enterprises are creating their own smart contracts. Should all smart contracts be decentralized, or do enterprise consortium blockchains make sense? </p><p>In this episode, Marley Gray from Microsoft joins the show to discuss enterprise smart contracts–why you would want to use them and how they can be architected. Marley has worked on banking and financial technology for over a decade, and makes some strong arguments for why banks will adopt smart contracts, and the timeline for how that might take place.</p><p>We would love for you to fill out our listener survey at <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/survey">softwareengineeringdaily.com/survey</a>.

This is is the fundamental question of the work of Donald Hoffman, a professor of computer science and cognitive science at UC Irvine. </p><p>When Hoffman was a child, he wondered whether there was a cognitive dividing line between humans and machines, and that curiosity has driven him to his current work–building a mathematical framework which we can use to model consciousness.</p><p>Humans would like to believe that evolution selects for traits that allow us to understand the world as it is. From his experimental simulations, Hoffman has shown the opposite–that evolution pushes us towards a mistaken version of reality.</p><p>For listeners who are interested in theories about whether we live in a simulation, this episode is for you. If you are skeptical of the simulation theory then this episode will also be useful for you, as Hoffman gives one of the most nuanced, comprehensive explanations of reality that I have heard.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYp5XuGYqqY">TED Talk</a></p><p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/04/the-illusion-of-reality/479559/">The Case Against Reality</a></p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>The number of ways that applications can fail are numerous. Disks fail all the time. Servers overheat. Network connections get flaky. You assume that you are prepared for such a scenario, because you have replicated your servers. You have the database backed up. Your core application is spread across multiple availability zones. </p><p>But are you really sure that your system is resilient? The only way to prove that your system is resilient to failure is to experience failure, and to make swift responsiveness to failure an integral part of your software.</p><p>Chaos engineering is the practice of routinely testing your system’s resilience by inducing controlled failures. Netflix was the first company to discuss chaos engineering widely, but more and more companies are starting to work it into their systems, and finding it tremendously useful. By inducing failures in your system, you can discover unknown dependencies, single points of failure, and problematic state conditions that can cause data corruption.</p><p>Kolton Andrus worked on chaos engineering at Netflix and Amazon, where he designed systems that would test system resiliency through routine failures. Since then, he founded Gremlin, a company that provides chaos engineering as a service. In a previous episode, Kolton and I discussed why chaos engineering is useful, and he told some awesome war stories about working at Amazon and Netflix. In this show, we explore how to build a chaos engineering service–which involves standing up Gremlin containers that institute controlled failures.</p><p>To find the previous episode I recorded with Kolton, as well as other supplementary materials described in this show, download the Software Engineering Daily app for <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/software-engineering-daily/id1253734426?mt=8">iOS</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.koalatea.thehollidayinn.softwareengineeringdaily&amp;hl=en">Android</a>.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Cryptocurrencies give us a decentralized financial system. OpenBazaar is a decentralized commerce system.</p><p>A merchant can log onto OpenBazaar and post a listing for an item–for example, a t-shirt that I want to sell for $15. My item listing will spread throughout the OpenBazaar P2P network. A shopper can download the OpenBazaar desktop application and see my listing for a t-shirt. The shopper can pay me $15 in bitcoin, and I will send the t-shirt to their address.</p><p>If I were selling that shirt on Amazon, the corporation would take a cut of that transaction. OpenBazaar has no transaction costs–so users get to save some money. However, users also miss out on the benefits of a corporate marketplace.</p><p>Amazon makes sure that the seller will send the item to the buyer, and makes sure that the buyer pays the seller. On OpenBazaar, an escrow system is needed to place money in the hands of a neutral third party until the goods are delivered. Amazon ensures that the distributor sends the item to the customer. On OpenBazaar, users need to figure out how to send the goods to each other.</p><p>Brian Hoffman was the first developer to start working on OpenBazaar. The project has grown significantly since his initial commit, and OpenBazaar now has buyers, sellers, and open source committers. There is a clear desire for an open system of commerce.  Brian is also the CEO of OB1, a company that provides services on top of OpenBazaar. OpenBazaar is a protocol–and other companies will undoubtedly emerge to build on top of it as well.</p><p>In our conversation, Brian discussed how OpenBazaar works–the peer-to-peer protocol, the escrow system, the dispute resolution, and the open source community management. It is a fascinating, unique project, and I hope you learn something about it from this episode.</p><p>To find all of our old episodes about decentralized technology and blockchains, you can download <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/software-engineering-daily-podcast-app/id1253734426?mt=8">the Software Engineering Daily app for iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.koalatea.thehollidayinn.softwareengineeringdaily">for Android</a>.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Every company has the idea of the “nightly report.” A business analyst comes into the office, sits down in front their inbox, and looks at yesterday’s data. Did sales go up? Did the marketing campaigns bring in the expected number of customers? Was there an increase in helpdesk tickets? The statistics that these reports deliver to human analysts can change the direction of the business.</p><p>Everyone within a company could use a regular report that documents how the business is changing over time. Outlier.ai is a company that processes the data sets within a business and generates automated reports that are relevant to different people within the organization. </p><p>If you are an email marketing analyst, your data from MailChimp campaigns will be analyzed. If you manage a customer success team, your Zendesk tickets will be analyzed. If you are a technical support analyst, the crash reports and error messages from your users will be analyzed. In all of these cases, the data gets processed automatically, and a story is sent to you, so that you can have the information in your inbox waiting for you, instead of having to go ask a data scientist to generate it for you.</p><p>Mike Kim is the CTO of Outlier.ai, and in this show he describes the engineering challenges of integrating with all the different data sets of an organization–and why there is so much value in the idea of the automated “report” or “story” for analysts.</p><p>In past shows, we have explored how data engineering has progressed over the last twenty years–from database administration to Hadoop cluster management to the emergence of “data breadlines” where analysts wait for a data scientist to process the job they asked for. Outlier represents a step towards a world where the data science reports are delivered to us before we even ask, rather than us having to query the system.</p><p>Transcript provided by We Edit Podcasts.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>The MapReduce paper was published by Google in 2004. MapReduce is an algorithm that describes how to do large-scale data processing on large clusters of commodity hardware. </p><p>The MapReduce paper marked the beginning of the “big data” movement. The Hadoop project is an open source implementation of the MapReduce paper. Doug Cutting and Mike Cafarella wrote software that allowed anybody to use MapReduce, as long as they had significant server operations knowledge and a rack of commodity servers.</p><p>Hadoop got deployed first at companies with the internal engineering teams that could recognize its importance and implement it–companies like Yahoo and Microsoft. The word quickly spread about the leverage Hadoop could provide.</p><p>Around this time, every large company was waking up to the fact that they had tons of data and didn’t know how to take advantage of it. Billion dollar corporations in areas like banking, insurance, manufacturing, and agriculture all wanted to take advantage of this amazing new way of looking at their data. But these companies did not have the engineering expertise to deploy Hadoop clusters.</p><p>Three big companies were formed to help bring Hadoop to large enterprises: Cloudera, Hortonworks, and MapR. Each of these companies worked with hundreds of large enterprise clients to build out their Hadoop clusters and help them access their data. Tomer Shiran spent five years at MapR, seeing the data problems of these large enterprises and observing how much value could be created by solving these data problems.</p><p>In 2015, eleven years had passed since MapReduce was first published, and companies were still having data problems. Tomer started working on Dremio, a company that was in stealth for another two years. I interviewed Tomer two years ago, when he still could not say much about what Dremio was doing. We talked about Apache Drill, an open-source project related to what Dremio eventually built.</p><p>Earlier this year, two of Tomer’s colleagues Jacques Nadeau and Julien Le Dem came on to discuss columnar data storage and interoperability. What I took away from that conversation was that today, data within an average enterprise is accessible, but the different formats are a problem. Some data is in MySQL, some is in Amazon S3, some is in ElasticSearch, some is on HDFS stored in Parquet files. Different teams will set up different BI tools and charts that read from a specific silo of data. </p><p>At the lowest level, the different data formats are incompatible–you have to transform MySQL data in order to merge it with S3 data. On top of that, engineers doing data science work are using Spark, Pandas, and other tools that pull lots of data into memory–if the in-memory formats are not compatible, the data teams can’t get the most out of their work. On top of THAT, at the highest level, data analysts are working with different data analysis tools, so there is even more siloing.</p><p>Now I understand why Dremio took two years to bring to market. </p><p>They are trying to solve data interoperability by making it easy to transform data sets between different formats. They are trying to solve data access speed by creating a sophisticated caching system. And they are trying to improve the effectiveness of the data analysts by providing the right abstractions for someone who is not a software engineer to study the different data sets across an organization.</p><p>Dremio is an exciting project because it is rare to see a pure software company put so many years into up-front stealth product development. After talking to Tomer in this conversation, I’m looking forward to seeing Dremio come to market. It was fascinating to hear him talk about how data engineering has evolved to today.</p><p>Some of the best episodes of Software Engineering Daily cover the history of data engineering, including an <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2016/03/09/hadoop-past-present-future-mike-cafarella/">interview with Mike Cafarella</a>, the co-founder of Hadoop, and another episode called <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2016/02/06/history-of-hadoop/">“The History of Hadoop”</a> in which we explored how Hadoop made it from a Google research paper into a multibillion dollar industry. </p><p>To find these old episodes, you can download <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/software-engineering-daily-podcast-app/id1253734426?mt=8">the Software Engineering Daily app for iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.koalatea.thehollidayinn.softwareengineeringdaily">for Android</a>.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>You are requesting a car from a ridesharing service such as Lyft. </p><p>Your request hits the Lyft servers and begins trying to get you a car. It takes your geolocation, and passes the geolocation to a service that finds cars that are nearby, and puts all those cars into a list. The list of nearby cars is sent to another service, which sorts the list of cars by how close they are to you, and how high their star rating is. Finally, your car is selected, and sent back to your phone in a response from the server.</p><p>In a “microservices” environment, multiple services often work together to accomplish a user task. In the example I just gave, one service took a geolocation and turned it into a list, another service took a list and sorted it, and another service sent the actual response back to the user.</p><p>This is a common pattern: Service A calls service B, which calls service C, and so on.  When one of those services fails along the way, how do you identify which one it was? When one of those services fails to deliver a response quickly, how do you know where your latency is coming from?</p><p>The solution is distributed tracing. To implement distributed tracing, each user level request gets a request identifier associated with it. When service A calls service B, it also hands off the unique request ID, so that the overall request can be traced as it passes through the distributed system (and if that doesn’t make sense–don’t worry, we explain it again during the show).</p><p>Ben Sigelman began working on distributed tracing when he was at Google and authored the “Dapper” paper. Dapper was implemented at Google to help debug some of the distributed systems problems faced by the engineers who work on Google infrastructure.</p><p>A request that moves through several different services spends time processing on each of those services. A distributed tracing system measures the time spent in each of those services–that time spent is called a span. A single request that has to hit 20 different services will have 20 spans associated with it. Those spans get collected into a trace. A trace can be evaluated to look at the latencies of each of those services. </p><p>If you are trying to improve the speed of a distributed systems infrastructure, distributed tracing can be very helpful for choosing where to focus your attention.</p><p>The published Google papers of ten years ago often turn out to be the companies of today. Some examples include MapReduce (which formed the basis of Cloudera), Spanner (which formed the basis of CockroachDB), and Dremel (which formed the basis of Dremio).</p><p>Today, a decade after he started thinking about distributed tracing, Ben Sigelman is the CEO of Lightstep, a company that provides distributed tracing and other monitoring technologies. </p><p>Lightstep’s distributed tracing model still bears a resemblance to the same techniques described in the paper–so I was eager to learn the differences between open source versions of distributed tracing (such as OpenZipkin) and enterprise providers such as Lightstep.</p><p>The key feature of Lightstep that we discussed: garbage collection.</p><p>If you are using a distributed tracing system, you could be collecting a lot of traces. You could collect a trace for every single user request. Not all of these traces are useful–but some of them are very useful. Maybe you only want to keep track of traces that take an exceptionally long latency. Maybe you want to keep every trace in the last 5 days, and destroy them over time. So, the question of how to manage the storage footprint of those traces was as interesting as the discussion of distributed tracing itself.</p><p>Beyond the distributed tracing features of his product, Ben has a vision for how his company can provide other observability tools over time. I spoke to Ben at Kubecon–and although this conversation does not talk about Kubernetes specifically, this topic is undoubtedly interesting to people who are building Kubernetes technologies.</p><p>Transcript provided by We Edit Podcasts.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>The Interplanetary File System (IPFS) is a decentralized global, peer-to-peer file system. IPFS combines ideas from BitTorrent, Git, and Bitcoin, creating a new way to store and access objects across the Internet.</p><p>When you access an object on almost any website, you are accessing the object via a location address—a URL. The URL tells you where to find the object. If the object is a photo on Facebook that you are linking to, the URL will have an address of somewhere on Facebook. Other objects that we access through URLs include web pages, videos, and JavaScript import packages.</p><p>URLs seem natural to us. You look up an object based on where that object is being stored. Why would you do anything differently?</p><p>A downside of location addressing is that if the location disappears, you can no longer access that object. If a government decides to censor a website that I wanted to visit, the government can shut down access to the server where that website sits, and my link will break. This happened in Turkey—where Wikipedia was shut down last year.</p><p>Objects in IPFS are content addressed—you access an object by giving IPFS a cryptographic hash of the object, and IPFS will find someone on the network who has a copy of that object, and give you access to it. </p><p>To look up a webpage in an IPFS browser, you put the content address in the address bar. When the HTML for that page is received, that page might have lots of other content-addressed files referred to on the page. Your browser can also grab all of those content-addressed files from the IPFS P2P network. </p><p>In this episode, David Dias explains how IPFS is designed. David is an engineer at Protocol Labs, the company building out IPFS. This episode is a great companion to our previous show with Juan Benet, the creator of IPFS.</p><p>Transcript provided by We Edit Podcasts.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Deep learning allows engineers to build models that can make decisions based on training data. These models improve over time using stochastic gradient descent. When a model gets big enough, the training must be broken up across multiple machines. Two strategies for doing this are “model parallelism” which divides the model across machines and “data parallelism” which divides the data across multiple copies of the model.</p><p>Distributed deep learning brings together two advanced software engineering concepts: distributed systems and deep learning. In this episode, Will Constable, the head of distributed deep learning algorithms at Intel Nervana, joins the show to give us a refresher on deep learning and explain how to parallelize training a model. </p><p>Full disclosure: Intel is a sponsor of Software Engineering Daily, and if you want to find out more about Intel Nervana including other interviews and job postings, go to <a href="http://softwareengineeringdaily.com/intel">softwareengineeringdaily.com/intel</a>.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>There is a quote from Jeff Bezos: “70% of the work of building a business today is undifferentiated heavy lifting. Only 30% is creative work. Things will be more exciting when those numbers are inverted.”</p><p>That quote is from 2006, before Amazon Web Services had built most of their managed services. In 2006, you had no choice but to manage your own database, data warehouse, and search cluster. If your server crashed in the middle of the night, you had to wake up and fix it. And you had to deal with these engineering problems in addition to building your business.</p><p>Technology today evolves much faster than in 2006. That is partly because managed cloud services make operating a software company so much smoother. You can build faster, iterate faster, and there are fewer outages.</p><p>If you are an insurance company or a t-shirt manufacturing company or an online education platform, software engineering is undifferentiated heavy lifting. Your customers are not paying you for your expertise in databases or your ability to configure load balancers. As a business, you should be focused on what the customers are paying you for, and spending the minimal amount of time on rebuilding software that is available as a commodity cloud service.</p><p>Rich Archbold is the director of engineering at Intercom, a rapidly growing software company that allows for communication between customers and businesses. At Intercom, the engineering teams have adopted <a href="https://youtu.be/f4p_4YY0ZzU">a philosophy called Run Less Software</a>. </p><p>Running less software means reducing choices among engineering teams, and standardizing on technologies wherever possible. </p><p>When Intercom was in its early days, the systems were more heterogeneous. Different teams could choose whatever relational database they wanted–MySQL or Postgres. They could choose whatever key/value store they were most comfortable with. </p><p>The downside of all this choice was that engineers who moved from one team to another team might not know how to use the tools at the new team they were moving to. After switching teams, you would have to figure out how to onboard with those new tools, and that onboarding process was time that was not spent on effort that impacted the business.</p><p>By reducing the number of different choices that engineering teams have, and opting for managed services wherever possible, Intercom ships code at an extremely fast pace with very few outages. In our conversation, Rich contrasts his experience at Intercom with his experiences working at Amazon Web Services and Facebook. </p><p>Amazon and Facebook were built in a time where there was not a wealth of managed services to choose from, and this discussion was a reminder of how much software engineering has changed because of cloud computing.</p><p>To learn more about Intercom, you can check out <a href="https://blog.intercom.com/category/podcast/">the Inside Intercom podcast</a>.</p><p>Transcript provided by We Edit Podcasts.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>A single user request hits Google’s servers. A user is looking for search results. </p><p>In order to deliver those search results, that request will have to hit several different internal services on the way to getting a response. </p><p>These different services work together to satisfy the user request. All of these services need to communicate efficiently, they need to scale, and they need to be secure. Services need to have a consistent way of being “observable”–allowing logging and monitoring. Services need to have proper security.</p><p>Since every service wants these different features (like communication, load balancing, security), it makes sense to build these features into a common system that can be deployed to every server.</p><p>Louis Ryan has spent his years at Google working on service infrastructure. During that time, he has seen massive changes in the way traffic flows through Google. First, the rise of Android, and all of the user traffic from mobile phones. And second, the rise of Google Cloud Platform, which meant that Google was now responsible for nodes deployed by users outside of Google.</p><p>These two changes–mobile and cloud–led to an increase in the amount of traffic and the type of traffic. All of this traffic leads to more internal services communicating with each other. How does service networking change in such an environment?</p><p>Google’s adaptation to the new networking conditions is to introduce a “service mesh”. A service mesh is a network for services. It provides observability, resiliency, traffic control, and other features to every service that plugs into it.</p><p>Each service needs to plug into the service mesh. In Kubernetes, services connect to the mesh through a sidecar. Let me explain the term “sidecar.”</p><p>Kubernetes manages its resources in pods, and each pod contains a set of containers. You might have a pod that is dedicated to responding to any user that is requesting a picture of a cat. Within that pod, you not only have the container that serves the cat picture–you also have other “sidecar” containers that help out an application container. </p><p>You could have a sidecar that gets deployed next to your application container that handles logging, or a sidecar that helps out with monitoring, or network communications. </p><p>If you are using the Istio service mesh, that means that you are using a sidecar called Envoy. Envoy is a sidecar called a “service proxy” that provides configuration updates, load balancing, proxying, and lots of other benefits. If we get all that out of Envoy, why do we need a separate abstraction of a “service mesh”? Because it helps to have a tool that aggregates and centralizes all the different communications among these proxies.</p><p>Every service gets a sidecar for a service proxy. Every service proxy communicates with the centralized service mesh.</p><p>Louis Ryan joins this episode to explain the motivations for building the Istio service mesh, and the problems it solves for Kubernetes developers.</p><p>For the next two weeks, we are covering exclusively the world of Kubernetes. Kubernetes is a project that is likely to have as much impact as Linux–and it is very early days. Whether you are an expert in Kubernetes or you are just starting out, we have lots of episodes to fit your learning curve.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>In an event driven application, each component of application logic emits events, which other parts of the application respond to. We have examined this pattern in previous shows that focus on pub/sub messaging, event sourcing, and CQRS. </p><p>In today’s show, we examine the intersection of event driven architecture and serverless architecture.</p><p>Serverless applications can be built by combining functions-as-a-service (like AWS Lambda) together with backend as a service tools like DynamoDB and Auth0. Functions-as-a-service give you cheap, flexible, scalable compute. Backend as a service tools give you robust, fault-tolerant tools for managing state. </p><p>By combining these sets of tools, we can build applications without thinking about specific servers that are managing large portions of our application logic. This is great–because managing servers and doing load balancing and scaling is painful.</p><p>With this shift in architecture, we also have to change how data flows through our applications. </p><p>Danilo Poccia is the author of <em>AWS Lambda In Action</em>, a book about building event-driven serverless applications. In today’s episode, Danilo and I discuss the connection between serverless architecture and event driven architecture. </p><p>We start by reviewing the evolution of the runtime unit–from physical machines to virtual machines to containers to functions as a service. Then, we dive into what it means for an application to be “event driven.” We explore how to architect and scale a serverless architecture, and we finish by discussing the future of serverless–how IoT and edge computing and on-premise architectures will take advantage of this new technology.</p><p>Transcript provided by We Edit Podcasts.

Facebook open sourced Relay around the same time they open sourced GraphQL, and Facebook expected Relay to be the more popular of the two projects.</p><p>However, the reality was reversed. Open source companies like Meteor quickly began to build GraphQL tools and a few businesses were started around GraphQL. One year later, the excitement for GraphQL had completely surpassed the excitement for Relay which had aged poorly in a newborn ecosystem of GraphQL tooling.</p><p>At the same time, Facebook was also starting to integrate Relay into their React Native apps. But Relay was performing poorly on low-end Android devices. This led the Relay team to the conclusion that they needed to rewrite Relay. Both to better fit into the growing GraphQL ecosystem, and to be built with performance in low-end React Native environments at the top of mind.</p><p>Relay Modern is the new version of Relay. It was released to the open source community at this year’s F8. In this episode Caleb Meredith is joined by Lee Byron, the co-creator of GraphQL, and Joe Savona, a founding member of the Relay team, to discuss Relay Modern. The discussion includes a conversation about the commercial GraphQL ecosystem, the story of why Facebook decided Relay needed to be rewritten, and a look at the future of UI development from some trends seen in Relay Modern.</p><p>Transcript provided by We Edit Podcasts.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>A company runs a variety of distributed systems applications such as Hadoop for batch processing jobs, Spark for data science, and Kubernetes for container management. These distributed systems tools can run on-prem, in a cloud provider, or in a hybrid system that uses on-prem and cloud infrastructure. Some enterprises use VMs, some use bare metal, some use both.</p><p>Mesosphere is a company that was started to abstract the complexity of resource management away from the application developer. Instead of a developer managing virtual machines, provisioning cloud infrastructure, or wiring all that infrastructure together to run distributed applications, the developer spins up distributed applications like Kubernetes, Spark, or Jenkins on top of Mesosphere, and Mesosphere provisions the machines on the underlying infrastructure.</p><p>Using Kubernetes on top of Mesos allows you to separate resource provisioning from the actual container orchestration. In a previous episode,<a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2016/10/12/netflix-scheduling-with-sharma-podila/"> we explored how Netflix uses Mesos</a> with a container orchestrator on top to simplify the resource management of microservice application containers as well as data science workloads.</p><p>Chris Gaun is a product manager at Mesosphere who helped build Kubernetes-as-a-service. In today’s show, he describes why it is useful to have separate layers for resource provisioning and container orchestration. He also talks about the difficulties of manually installing Kubernetes, and why Mesosphere built a Kubernetes-as-a-service product. Full disclosure: Mesosphere is a sponsor of Software Engineering Daily.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Medical breakthroughs require medical research. Medical research requires patient testing and data collection. The most common form of capturing patient data is through surveys–and most of those surveys today are done on paper.</p><p>Surveying patients to understand the side effects or benefits of trial drugs or treatments, and getting accurate results out of these are critical aspects of medical research. Traditionally, these surveys are filled and read manually, and entered into a database by a human operator. In these steps, there is too much room for human error, from unreadable handwritings to typos being entered into the databas</p><p>Electronic Data Capture platforms were created out of this need for easy and accurate data collection for researches. By enabling online survey creation and result collection, EDC platforms improved medical research immensely.</p><p>However, these platforms are complex to design. Where patient medical data is concerned, privacy and security are of extremely high importance. Compliance with laws that protect anonymity and privacy of the patients is necessary. On top of these, the platform must be easy-to-use, and reliable. </p><p>Castor EDC is a company specializing on EDC for medical research, founded in the Netherlands and active in many countries around the globe. Our guest today is Derk Arts, the founder and CEO of Castor EDC. </p><p>In this episode we discuss Electronic Data Capture platforms, how Castor EDC overcame the engineering and design problems, how they comply with the laws, and their business model.</p>',

A browser is a large piece of software, with engineering challenges around threading, rendering, resource management, and networking. To add to the complexity, Chrome runs on iOS, Android, MacOSX, Windows, and other platforms.</p><p>Chrome OS is an operating system based on Chrome. There is also Chromium OS, the open source version of Chrome OS. The Chrome/Chromium operating systems are based off of Linux. </p><p>Through this entire episode, the line between browser and operating system is blurry. There is so much resource management involved in the Chrome browser that it has its own task manager.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Algorithms for building neural networks have existed for decades. For a long time, neural networks were not widely used. Recent changes to the cost of compute and the size of our data have made neural networks extremely useful. Our smart phones generate terabytes of useful data. Lower storage costs make it economical to keep that data. Cloud computing democratized the ability to do large scale machine learning across GPUs. </p><p>Over the last few years, these trends have been driving widespread use of deep learning, in which neural nets with a large series of layers are used to create powerful results in various fields of classification and prediction. Neural networks are a tool for making sense of unstructured data–text, images, sound waves, and videos. </p><p>“Unstructured” data is data with high volume or high dimensionality. For example, an image has a huge collection of pixels, and each pixel has a color value. One way to think about image classification is that you are finding correlations between those pixels. A certain cluster of pixels might represent an edge. After doing edge detection on pixels, you have a collection of edges. Then you can find correlations between those edges, and build up higher levels of abstraction.</p><p>Yinyin Liu is a principal engineer and head of data science at the Intel AI products group. She studies techniques for building neural networks. Each different configuration of a neural network for a given problem is called a “topology.” Engineers are always looking at new topologies for solving a deep learning application–such as natural language processing.</p><p>In this episode, Yinyin describes what a deep learning topology is and describes topologies for natural language processing. We also talk about the opportunities and the bottlenecks in deep learning–including why the tools are so immature, and what it will take to make the tooling better.</p><p>Transcript provided by We Edit Podcasts.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Open source software allows developers to take code from the Internet and modify it for their own use. Open source has allowed innovation to occur on a massive scale. Today, open source software powers our consumer client applications and our backend cloud server infrastructure. </p><p>Linux powers single node operating systems and Kubernetes is the foundation for new distributed systems. Hadoop created an open source distributed file system, Spark gave us a computational runtime on top of it, and Kafka created a middleware platform for shuttling data from one place to another.</p><p>There are numerous other examples of how open source has changed the world of software development. Open source has also reshaped the business landscape of infrastructure software companies. </p><p>A common business structure for a modern infrastructure company is the “open core” model. An open core company maintains an open source project that is free to use, but also sells a product or service around that product. Companies with an open core model include Red Hat, HashiCorp, and GitLab.</p><p>Many companies are building a thriving business with the open core business model. But these companies do not directly control the most important part of the infrastructure supply chain: the cloud provider.</p><p>Cloud providers have a fundamental tension with open core companies because the cloud providers offer services that compete with the open core companies. </p><p>In addition to the issue of cloud providers competing directly with the open core companies, some people have questioned whether Amazon Web Services is capturing an unfair portion of the value that is being created by open source.</p><p>Amazon Web Services is the biggest cloud provider, and it has built a large catalog of services that are built off of open source software. But AWS has not historically contributed heavily to open source relative to the value it has captured. </p><p>One example of an open core company which has lost market share to an AWS cloud-hosted offering is Elastic, the open core company which maintains the ElasticSearch open source project. Amazon ElasticSearch Service is a closed-source hosted offering built on top of the ElasticSearch.</p><p>Elastic (the company) has increasingly intermingled proprietary software with their open source repository, making it less clear how that open source repository can be used by companies that want to deploy it for their commercial use.</p><p>Open core companies such as MongoDB, Redis Labs, and Cockroach Labs have responded to the competitive pressures of AWS by changing their licenses and making it more expensive for cloud providers to offer a cloud-hosted offering of their open source project.</p><p>The dynamics between cloud providers and open core companies will continue to evolve in the coming years. The norms around open source are up for debate.</p><p>Joseph Jacks is the founder of OSS Capital, a venture firm focused on investments in commercial open source software companies. He returns to the show to discuss the changing landscape of open core companies, and the benefits of permissionless innovation.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>When you go to a website where a video is playing, and your video lags, how does the website know that you are having a bad experience? </p><p>Problems with video are often not complete failures–maybe part of the video loads, and plays just fine, and then the rest of the video is buffering. You have probably experienced sitting in front of a video, waiting for it to load as the loading wheel mysteriously spins.</p><p>Since problems with video are often not complete failures, troubleshooting a problem with a user’s video playback is not as straightforward as just logging whenever a crash occurs. You need to continuously monitor the video playback on every client device and aggregate it in a centralized system for analysis.</p><p>The centralized logging system will allow you to separate problems with a specific user from problems with the video service itself. A single user could have bad wifi, or have 50 tabs open with different videos. To identify problems that are caused by the video player rather than the user, you need to capture the playback from every video and every user.</p><p>Scott Kidder works at Mux, where he builds a streaming analytics system for video monitoring. In this episode, Scott explains how events make it from a video player onto the backend analytics system running on Kinesis and Apache Flink. </p><p>Events from the browser are constantly added to Kinesis (which is much like Kafka). Apache Flink reads those events off of Kinesis and map reduces them to discover anomalies. For example, if 100 users watch a 20 minute cat video, and the video stops playing at minute 12 for all 100 users, there is probably some data corruption in that video. You would only be able to discover that by assessing all users.</p><p>Scott and I discussed the streaming infrastructure that he works on at Mux, as well as other streaming systems like Spark, Apache Beam, and Kafka. </p><p>This episode is the first in a short series about streaming data infrastructure. I wanted to do some shows in preparation for Strata Data conference in March in San Jose, which I will be attending thanks to a complimentary ticket from O’Reilly. O’Reilly has been kind enough to give me free tickets since Software Engineering Daily started and did not have the money to attend any conferences.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Matt Klein has worked for three rapidly growing Internet companies. At AWS, he worked on EC2, the compute-as-a-service product that powers a large percentage of the Internet. At Twitter, he helped scale the infrastructure in the chaotic days before Twitter’s IPO. Today he works at Lyft, building systems to allow for ride sharing infrastructure to work more safely and reliably.</p><p>Hypergrowth Internet companies are faced with quickly growing demands on their software. The demands on the software expose problems with the core infrastructure. Simultaneously, the company tries to ramp up its hiring process. More engineers get hired, and the institutional knowledge within the company starts to weaken. Documentation gets out of date. Senior engineers burn out and leave the company.</p><p>When a company starts growing quickly, communications can break down. A hypergrowth company can suffer from a lack of “human scalability”. Matt Klein has observed these challenges at AWS, Twitter, and Lyft. In his article <a href="https://medium.com/@mattklein123/the-human-scalability-of-devops-e36c37d3db6a">“The Human Scalability of ‘DevOps’”</a>, he explains why these problems manifest and what can be done to alleviate them. </p><p>In a previous show, Matt discussed <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2017/02/14/service-proxying-with-matt-klein/">the engineering challenges at Lyft that led him to create Envoy</a>, a service proxy. This episode covers some broad technical topics–DevOps, site reliability engineering, platform engineering–but the episode is mostly about how a hypergrowth company can manage culture, hiring, and engineering organization. </p><p>Matt is a very fun guest to have because he questions some of the strange practices that have been widely adopted by successful companies. Internet companies are a very new phenomenon, and the management tactics that they have adopted are not well proven–so it is great to have someone like Matt provide a fresh perspective on ways that companies can scale their technology and their organization more effectively.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>The labor market is moving online.</p><p>Taxi drivers are joining Uber and Lyft. Digital freelancers are selling their services through Fiverr. Experienced software contractors are leaving contract agencies to join Gigster. Online labor marketplaces create market efficiency by improving the communications between buyers and sellers. Workers make their own hours, and their performance is judged by customers and algorithms, rather than the skewed perspective of a human manager.</p><p>These marketplaces for human labor are in different verticals, but they share a common problem: how do you most efficiently match supply and demand?</p><p>Perfect marketplace matching is an unsolved problem. Hundreds of computer science papers have been written about the problems of stable matching, which often turn out to be NP-Complete. The stock market has been attempting to automate marketplace matching for decades, and inefficiencies are discovered every year.</p><p>Today’s show is about matching buyers and sellers on Thumbtack, a marketplace for local services.</p><p>For the first seven years, Thumbtack was building liquidity in its 2-sided market. During those years, the model for job requests was as follows: let’s say I was on Thumbtack looking for someone to paint my house. I would post a job that would say I am looking for house painters. The workers on Thumbtack that paint houses could see my job and place a bid on it. Then I would choose from the bids and get my house painted.</p><p>This was the “asynchronous” model. The actions of the buyer and seller were not synchronized. There was a significant delay between the time when the buyer posted a job and the time when a seller places a bid, and then another delay before the buyer selects from the sellers.</p><p>Thumbtack recently moved to an “instant matching” model. After gathering data about the people selling services on the platform, Thumbtack is now able to avoid the asynchronous bidding process. In the new experience, a buyer goes on the platform, requests a house painter, and is instantly matched to someone who has a history of accepting house painting tasks that fit the parameters of the buyer.</p><p>From the user’s perspective, this is a simple improvement. From Thumbtack’s perspective, there was significant architectural change required. In the asynchronous model, the user requests lined up in a queue, and were matched with pros who placed bids on the items in that queue. In the instant matching model, a user request became more like a search query–the parameters of that request hit an index of pros and returns a response immediately.</p><p>Xing Chen is an engineer from Thumbtack, and joins the show to describe the rearchitecture process–how Thumbtack went from an asynchronous matching system to synchronous, instant matching. We also explore some of the other architectural themes of Thumbtack, which we dive into in further detail in tomorrow’s episode about scaling Thumbtack’s infrastructure, which uses both AWS and Google Cloud.</p><p>On Software Engineering Daily, we have explored the software architecture and business models of different labor marketplaces–from Uber to Fiverr.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Most technology companies rely on open source software projects. But open source software projects are often maintained by a group of people that is not affiliated with any particular company. When an open source project develops too much technical debt, it can become a tragedy of the commons. Who is responsible for maintaining these open source projects?</p><p>This is the motivation for open source bounties. Companies and individuals who rely on open source create bounties, which are financial incentives for developers to solve problems within the open source project.</p><p>Kevin Owocki is the creator of Gitcoin, a platform for open source bounties that is mediated by an Ethereum smart contract. Kevin joins the show to discuss his experience building Gitcoin–as well as some of the problems with the blockchain space, such as rampant ICOs. Gitcoin is NOT a cryptocurrency or token itself–it is a platform for open source software to be built more efficiently. Kevin was an awesome guest and you will enjoy the conversation.</p><p>Gitcoin is a nice example of a real-world Ethereum use case–it uses Ethereum for escrow: if I post a $25 bounty for someone to fix a bug in my open source project, I will lock up ether in a smart contract. When the bug is fixed, the programmer who fixed it will submit a pull request on Github, and I will release the ether from the smart contract to pay them.</p><p>We would love for you to fill out our listener survey at <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/survey">softwareengineeringdaily.com/survey</a>.

In user space, the user can create and interact with a variety of applications directly. In kernel space, the Linux kernel provides a stable environment in which device drivers interact with hardware and manage low level resources.</p><p>A Linux container is a virtualized environment that runs within user space.  To perform an operation, a process in a container in user space makes a syscall (system call) into kernel space. This allows the container to have access to resources like memory and disk.</p><p>Kernel space must be kept secure to ensure operating system integrity–but Linux includes hundreds of syscalls. Each syscall represents an interface between the user space and kernel space. Security vulnerabilities can emerge from this wide attack surface of different syscalls, and most applications only need a small number of syscalls to perform their required functionality. </p><p>gVisor is a project to restrict the number of syscalls that the kernel and user space need to communicate. gVisor is a runtime layer between the user space container and the kernel space. gVisor reduces the number of syscalls that can be made into kernel space.</p><p>The security properties of gVisor make it an exciting project today–but it is the portability features of gVisor that hint at a huge future opportunity. By inserting an interpreter interface between containers and the Linux kernel, gVisor presents the container world with the opportunity to run on operating systems other than Linux.</p><p>There are many reasons why it might be appealing to run containers on an operating system other than Linux. </p><p>Linux was built many years ago, before the explosion of small devices, smart phones, IoT hubs, voice assistants and smart cars. To be more speculative, Google is working on a secretive new operating system called Fuscia. gVisor could be a layer that allows workloads to be ported from Linux servers to Fuscia servers.</p><p>Yoshi Tamura is a product manager at Google with a background in containers and virtualization.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Mesos is a system for managing distributed systems. The goal of Mesos is to help engineers orchestrate resources among multi-node applications like Spark. Mesos can also manage lower level schedulers like Kubernetes. A common misconception is that Mesos aims to solve the same problem as Kubernetes, but Mesos is a higher level abstraction.</p><p>Ben Hindman co-founded Mesosphere to bring the Mesos project to market. Large enterprises like Uber, Netflix, and Yelp use Mesosphere for resource management. Before he started the company, Ben worked in the Berkeley AMP Lab, a research program where the Spark and Tachyon projects were also born. </p><p>At this point, he has spent significant time in both academia and industry. This conversation spans distributed systems theory, history, and practice. Ben and I spoke at KubeCon 2018 in Copenhagen–which was an amazing conference. We were both amazed at how big the audience for Kubernetes has gotten, and the pace at which the technology is advancing.</p><p>Today, Kubernetes is mostly used for scheduling containerized applications that engineers have built themselves. But there will be higher level tools that use Kubernetes as a building block. Much like Zookeeper was used as a building block for Hadoop, Kubernetes will be used to build serverless applications and distributed databases. </p><p>Once you are using a distributed database built on Kubernetes, you don’t want to think about the container orchestration–you want to think about the raw storage and CPU requirements for that database. This is one reason why Mesos is so compelling. Since Kubernetes creates an increased cardinality of distributed systems, it’s good to know that there is a framework built to manage those higher level applications.</p><p>Transcript provided by We Edit Podcasts.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Modern architectures often consist of containers that run services. Those containers scale up and down depending on the demand for the services. These large software systems often use a technique known as event sourcing, where every change to the system is kept in an event log. When an event on the log is processed, several different data stores might be updated in response.</p><p>In these architectures, containers are interacting with each other. Multiple databases are responding to events in the event log. To connect these systems together, engineers can write small functions to pass data around–you might call these small connecting functions “glue.” Glue functions are a great use for a serverless tool such as AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions. As these glue functions grow in popularity, there is an increased need for an open source way to deploy serverless functions.</p><p>Sebastian Goasgoen works on Kubeless, a serverless execution tool built on top of Kubernetes. In this episode, we explore his take on the “serverless on Kubernetes” problem. This is a great companion episode to yesterday’s interview with Soam Vasani.</p><p>Software Engineering Daily is looking for sponsors for Q3.

Those dynamic ad slots are available to a variety of different bidders. For each ad slot, an auction occurs. The highest bidder gets to serve an ad for that slot.</p><p>Praneet Sharma is the co-founder of Method Media Intelligence, which he founded with Shailin Dhar, who has been on the show several times to discuss his investigations into the world of ad fraud. I wanted to have his partner Praneet on the show to get his perspective on ad fraud and how to clean up the advertising ecosystem.</p><p>One advance in dynamic advertising that we discussed is header bidding, and an open source library called PrebidJS.</p><p>When an ad-supported website gets delivered to your web browser, the HTML begins to load and the JavaScript on the page begins to execute. Some of that JavaScript is calling out to advertising networks looking for the highest bidder. Until the page receives a callback for what to put in the ad slots on the page, the page will not finish loading. Sites that do not manage their ad requests appropriately suffer performance issues.</p><p>Header bidding is a technique to wrap all of the requests to different advertising exchanges in a single serialized blob of code at the top of the page.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Facebook was built using PHP, a programming language that was used widely in the late 90s and early 2000s. PHP allows developers to get web applications built quickly and easily, although PHP has a reputation for being difficult to scale. </p><p>In the early days of Facebook, the company was scaling rapidly on every dimension. </p><p>New users were piling into Facebook. Existing users were increasing their interactions and developing new patterns of usage. The Facebook application was rolling out new features quickly, adding them into the Facebook PHP codebase.</p><p>A common pattern for scaling a large software application is to use a microservices architecture, breaking up the monolithic application into small services which can scale independently. For many applications, this pattern works well. But for some applications, microservices makes less sense.</p><p>Microsoft Excel is one example. In Excel, a user is making updates to a complex data model using formulas, functions, and other in-app tools that need to be fast, performant, and integrated. The user needs to have a sense that the Excel data model will update quickly in response to changes. </p><p>A software team working on a spreadsheet product such as Excel might prefer to keep all the application logic in a monolithic application. </p><p>A monolith can centralize logic and make it easier to reason about. A monolith can reduce the number of network hops, cutting down on distributed systems problems. Testing and deploying a monolithic application can be less complex than doing so in a distributed, microservices system.</p><p>Facebook chose to scale its PHP monolith rather than breaking it up into distributed microservices. Scaling PHP allowed Facebook to continue moving fast without going through a painful refactoring that would have slowed down the entire company. </p><p>The first effort to scale PHP involved transpiling the entire PHP application into C++. This C++ version of Facebook ran faster and with a lower memory footprint. But C++ required ahead-of-time compilation: the PHP codebase had to be converted to C++ in one synchronous step.</p><p>The Hip Hop Virtual Machine (HHVM) was started to allow the Facebook PHP monolith to run on the V8 JavaScript virtual machine. </p><p>The advantage of running PHP on V8 was that it allowed Facebook to transpile PHP to JavaScript, an interpreted language that fit better with Facebook’s dynamic application build path. HHVM also allows Facebook to take advantage of the rapidly improving JavaScript runtime environment.</p><p>Keith Adams was an engineer at Facebook for six years, where he helped develop infrastructure to scale PHP effectively. Keith is now the chief architect at Slack, which is also a scaled PHP application. Keith returns to Software Engineering Daily to discuss why and how Facebook scaled PHP.</p>',

Whatever its stated purpose, its effective purpose is to create a mechanism of deficit spending by politicians, through the insidious invisible taxation of monetary debasement (aka inflation).”</p><p>These are the words of Erik Voorhees, the CEO of crypto financial exchange ShapeShift. Long before he started ShapeShift, Erik was opposed to some of the core principles of the global financial system, in which he sees the US dollar as a means of control. As an early adopter of Bitcoin, he saw a way to make financial transactions without using fiat currency.</p><p>Erik’s company ShapeShift allows users to convert different digital currencies between each other. Because it only makes exchanges of currencies and does not hold much currency at any time, ShapeShift is resilient to hacking.</p><p>In this episode, Erik and I discussed his economic philosophy, and how that informs his affinity for cryptocurrencies. Erik also describes the architecture of ShapeShift, and gives some advice for how to think about building businesses around cryptocurrencies. ShapeShift has had a few near-death experiences, like any startup, and there is a useful story in this episode about how to survive and recover from a serious business setback.</p><p>Transcript provided by We Edit Podcasts.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Large-scale data analysis was pioneered by Google, with the MapReduce paper. Since then, Google’s approach to analytics has evolved rapidly, marked by papers such as Dataflow and Dremel. </p><p>Dremel combined a column-oriented, distributed file system with a novel way of processing queries. A single Dremel query is distributed into a tree of servers, starting with the root server, splitting into the intermediate servers, and ending with the leaf servers talking to the file system. Once the data is pulled from the file system into the leaves, the data propagates back to the root server, and is shuffled along the way so that the root server receives a sorted response.</p><p>When Google started turning its internal services into customer-facing cloud products, the effort to productize Dremel began, and BigQuery was born. Jordan Tigani is an engineering lead who works on BigQuery, and he joins the show to discuss the evolution of the data warehouse. </p><p>Large scale distributed queries still can take a long time–but queries get faster every year. Queries that required a nightly Hadoop job 10 years ago can be viewed in a frequently updated user-facing dashboard. Power users of BigQuery talk about the speed and the query interface as being two of its most valuable differentiating features. As the job of a large scale data analyst becomes less technically intensive, tools like BigQuery will continue to rise in popularity.</p><p>We have done some great shows about Google papers like Spanner, Dremel, and Dataflow.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p><em>Originally published May 24, 2018</em></p><p>When a user takes a ride on Uber, the app on the user’s phone is communicating with Uber’s backend infrastructure, which is writing to a database that maintains the state of that user’s activity. This database is known as a transactional database or “OLTP” (online transaction processing). Every active user and driver and UberEATS restaurant is writing data to the transactional data store.</p><p>Periodically, that data is copied from the transactional data system to a different data storage system, where that data can be queried for large-scale data analysis. For example, if a data scientist at Uber wants to get the average amount of miles that a given user rode in February, that data scientist would issue a query to the analytical data cluster.</p><p>Uber uses the Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS) to store analytical data. On this file system, Uber has a version history of all of the company’s useful historical data. Trip history, rider activity, driver activity–every data point that is in the transactional database–but in a file format that is easier to query for large scale processing. This file format is known as Parquet.</p><p>Data scientists, machine learning engineers, and real-time application developers all depend on the massive quantities of data that are stored in these Parquet files on Uber’s HDFS cluster. To simplify the access of that data by many different clients, Uber uses Presto, an analytical query engine originally built at Facebook. </p><p>Presto translates SQL queries into whatever query language is necessary to access the underlying storage medium–whether that storage system is an ElasticSearch cluster, a set of Parquet files, or a relational database. Presto is useful because it simplifies the relationship between data engineers and the application developers who are building on top of the data engineering infrastructure.</p><p>In today’s show, Zhenxiao Luo joins to give an end-to-end description of Uber’s data infrastructure–from the ingest point of the OLTP database to the OLAP data storage system on HDFS, to the wide range of data systems and applications that run on top of that OLAP data.</p>',

Networks can drop packets, machines can run out of memory, and the Netflix app on a user’s device can have a bug. All of these events can result in a bad user experience.</p><p>Other errors can occur that do not disrupt the user experience. Netflix runs thousands of machine learning jobs, logging servers, and other pieces of internal infrastructure. Customer service dashboards, CI/CD pipelines, and AB testing frameworks are all software built by Netflix–and when an error occurs in any of these places, engineers need to be able to diagnose and debug that error.</p><p>Observability is the practice of using logs, monitoring, metrics, and distributed tracing to understand how a system is working. Kevin Lew is a senior software engineer at Netflix with the Edge Insights team. He joins the show to talk about adding observability across the microservices deployed at Netflix.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Different databases have different access patterns. Key-value, document, graph, and columnar databases are useful under different circumstances. </p><p>For example, if you are a bank, and you have a database of customers and the transactions they have performed, the ideal access pattern for aggregating the total amount of all transactions might be a columnar store. If the transaction amounts are all in one column, it helps to have all of the columnar entries close together on disk.</p><p>But if you want to look at your bank as a social network, and you want to be able to map how money flows between the different people who use your bank, you might want to map your data as a graph database. That would make it easier to query for the connections across the different users in the bank.</p><p>CosmosDB is a database from Microsoft that allows for multiple data models and multiple well-defined consistency models. Today’s guest Andy Hoh is a product manager at Azure CosmosDB and he joins the show to describe the product.</p><p>Microsoft unveiled CosmosDB at Build, their annual developer conference, which is where I performed this interview. It was a pleasure hanging out at Build in the podcast booths they set up, so thanks to Microsoft for inviting me.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>When engineers are writing code, they are manipulating objects. You might have a user object represented on your computer, and that user object has several different fields—a name, a gender, and an age. </p><p>When you want to send that object across the network to a different computer, the object needs to be turned into a sequence of 1s and 0s that will travel efficiently across the network. This is known as “serialization.”</p><p>As the user object sits on your computer, it is represented in 1s and 0s. You could just send that same representation over the wire. But we use efficient serialization to send it over the network in a more compact format. We also have to make sure that when we send that object to another service, the other service knows how to deserialize it, and turn it back into a format that we can operate on at the application level.</p><p>Protocol buffers are a serialization protocol that originated at Google. Protocol buffers created a standardized interface for efficiently passing data between services. When Kenton Varda worked at Google, he was the tech lead for protocol buffers, and he joins the show to explain how protobufs work—and a newer serialization protocol that Kenton led: Cap’n Proto. </p><p>You can expect to walk away from this episode with an understanding of how serialization protocols work, and the design tradeoffs you can make when creating a serialization protocol.</p><p>We also touched on a startup that Kenton founded, called Sandstorm, and how he eventually found himself at Cloudflare, where he works on Cloudflare workers. With these topics, we did not go as deep as I would have liked, and I look forward to having Kenton back on in the near future.</p><p>Transcript provided by We Edit Podcasts.

These different operating system distributions were created to fulfill different needs. Linux is used for Raspberry Pis, Android phones, and enterprise workstations. These different use cases require different configurations of an operating system.</p><p>Similarly, there are different distributions of Kubernetes because there are different types of distributed systems. The internal infrastructure of a cloud provider might use one type of Kubernetes to serve users running application containers. A network of smart security cameras might be networked together with a different distribution of Kubernetes.</p><p>Brian Gracely and Michael Hausenblas join the show today to discuss Kubernetes distributions.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>When a database gets large, it can start to perform poorly. This can manifest in slow query speed. You can speed up a query by defining an index, which is a data structure that allows for faster access to the data that is being indexed. As a consequence, whenever you update the database, you will now need to update the index with that new piece of data.</p><p>The more you index your data, the faster the access time. In order to have more indexes you must pay a write penalty in order to maintain consistency around that data, since the indexes need to be updated with each new entry. This illustrates one simple tradeoff that a developer can make within a database deployment.</p><p>Why are there so many different databases in the world? Why do we need SQL databases like Postgres, document databases like MongoDB, key/value systems like Cassandra, and search systems like Elasticsearch? Because each of these each system optimizes for different sets of tradeoffs. Tradeoffs can affect the speed of a read, the speed of a write, the user experience, the consistency of data, and the cost of running the database.</p><p>Andrew Davidson is the lead product manager of MongoDB Atlas. Andrew joins the show to talk about how database performance can degrade when a database gets large, and how to measure and optimize performance of a critical database.</p><p>Andrew explores the range of distributed systems cases–from a single node database to a multi-geographic distribution of nodes around the world, and describes how the configuration of a database in the cloud can help or hurt the application that the database is serving.<br>\nFull disclosure: MongoDB is a sponsor of Software Engineering Daily.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Edge computing refers to computation involving drones, connected cars, smart factories, or IoT sensors. Any software deployment that is not a large centralized server installation could qualify as an edge device–even a smartphone.</p><p>Today, much of our heavy computation takes place in the cloud–a set of remote data centers some distance away from our client devices. For many use cases, this works fine. But there are a growing number of use cases with lower latency and higher bandwidth requirements at the edge. </p><p>A simple example is video. Let’s say you want to record a video stream, and detect people in that video stream in real time. Based on who those people in the video stream are, you want to do different things–maybe you want to send them a text message, or report to the police that a dangerous person has entered the premises. This video stream could be captured by a drone, or by a smart car, or by a video camera mounted somewhere.</p><p>Where is the video stream getting stored? Where is the machine learning model running? How do you deploy new machine learning models to the operating system with the machine learning model? This is a simple example, and there are many open questions as to how to best solve such a problem.</p><p>With the increased resource constraints at the edge, there is a need for new hardware and software to power these edge applications. This led to the creation of LF Edge, a new open source group under the Linux Foundation. The goal of LF Edge is to build an open source framework for the edge.</p><p>Arpit Joshipura is the general manager of networking, orchestration, edge computing, and IoT with the Linux Foundation. He joins the show to describe the state of edge computation, and the mission of LF Edge.</p><p>This episode was exciting for several reasons. After seeing the rise of Kubernetes for container orchestration, we know that a popular open source technology that solves a widespread problem can have dramatic influence on the software world. And when multiple large companies get involved in that open source project, it can gain traction quite quickly.</p><p>Edge computing has a large set of unanswered questions, but telecom providers like AT&amp;T and large infrastructure companies like Dell EMC are getting heavily involved with the Linux Foundation Edge group. This represents a significant expansion of the open source model, and a suggestion of further investment into open source projects in the near future.</p>',

Prometheus includes a multi-dimensional data model, a query language called PromQL, and a pull model for gathering metrics from your different services. Prometheus is widely used by large distributed systems deployments such as Kubernetes and Cloud Foundry.</p><p>Prometheus gathers metrics from your services by periodically scraping those services. Those metrics get gathered, compressed, and stored onto disk for querying. But Prometheus is designed to store all of its records on one host in one set of files–which limits the scalability and availability of those metrics.</p><p>Cortex is an open source project built to scale Prometheus. Cortex effectively shards Prometheus by parallelizing the “ingestion” and storage of Prometheus metrics. Cortex can take metrics from multiple Prometheus instances and store them across a distributed NoSQL database like DynamoDB, BigTable, or Cassandra.</p><p>Bryan Boreham is an engineer at Weaveworks, where he works on deployment, observability, and monitoring tools for containers and microservices. He wrote much of the code for Cortex, and we met up at KubeCon North America to talk about the motivation for creating Cortex, the broader landscape of Kubernetes monitoring, and other approaches to scaling Prometheus.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Kent Beck is a legendary figure in the world of software engineering. </p><p>Kent was an early advocate of Test-Driven Development (TDD), and popularized the idea of writing unit tests before writing code that would satisfy those unit tests. A unit test isolates and tests a small piece of functionality within a large piece of software. Practitioners of Test-Driven Development write tens or hundreds of tests in order to cover a large variety of cases that could potentially occur within their software.</p><p>When Kent Beck joined Facebook in 2011, he was 50 years old and thought he had seen everything in the software industry. During Facebook Boot Camp, Kent started to realize that Facebook was very different than any other company he had seen. Facebook Boot Camp is the six-week onboarding process that every new hire learns about the software practices of the company.</p><p>After graduating Facebook Boot Camp, Kent began to explore Facebook’s codebase and culture. He found himself rethinking many of the tenets of software engineering that he had previously thought were immutable.</p><p>Kent joins the show to discuss his time at Facebook, and how the company’s approach to building and scaling products thoroughly reshaped his beliefs about software engineering.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p><em>Originally posted on May 12, 2015.</em></p><p>Humans have now been defeated by computers at heads up no-limit holdem poker. </p><p>Some people thought this wouldn’t be possible. Sure, we can teach a computer to beat a human at Go or Chess. Those games have a smaller decision space. There is no hidden information. There is no bluffing. Poker must be different! It is too human to be automated.</p><p>The game space of poker is different than that of Go. It has 10^160 different situations–which is more than the number of atoms in the universe. And the game space keeps getting bigger as the stack sizes of the two competitors gets bigger.</p><p>But it is still possible for a computer to beat a human at calculating game theory optimal decisions–if you approach the problem correctly.</p><p>Libratus was developed by CMU professor Tuomas Sandholm, along with my guest today Noam Brown. The Libratus team taught their AI the rules of poker, they gave it a reward function (to win as much money as possible), and they told it to optimize that reward function. Then they had Libratus train itself with simulations.</p><p>After enough training, Libratus was ready to crush human competitors, which it did in hilarious, entertaining fashion. There is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLXPGwJNLHk">video from Engadget on YouTube</a> about the AI competing against professional humans.</p><p>In this episode, Noam Brown explains how they built Libratus, what it means for poker players, and what the implications are for humanity–if we can automate poker, what can’t we automate?</p><p>Stay tuned at the end of this episode for the Indeed Prime tip on hiring developers.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Kubernetes is an orchestration system for managing containers. Since it was open sourced by Google, Kubernetes has created a wave of innovation in the infrastructure technology space. </p><p>Another recent innovation has been the “serverless” execution tools–such as AWS Lambda and Google Cloud Functions. Serverless execution, otherwise known as functions-as-a-service, allows a developer to execute code against cloud servers without specifying which cloud servers they are executing on.</p><p>Serverless execution is a cheap, flexible resource that any large company wants to have access to. But AWS Lambda and the other popular serverless tools are closed source. This led Soam Vasani to work on Fission, a serverless executor that sits on top of Kubernetes.</p><p>If you have not heard about either Kubernetes or Serverless, you can check out our previous episodes about <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/tag/kubernetes/">either</a> <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/?s=serverless">topic</a>.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Slack is a real-time messaging system for work communication. On Slack, chat rooms as big as 100,000 people have productive conversations. This might sound like the same problem solved by social networks like Facebook, where billions of users communicate over a newsfeed. But the engineering constraints of a messaging system are different than that of a social network.</p><p>On a newsfeed, the order in which events appear is not chronological. Events can be out of order. You can miss events. When a user posts a message to a social network, there are not strict guarantees around when other people will see that message.</p><p>On Slack, messages have strong guarantees around arrival. When I send a message, everyone else who is in the room and connected should quickly receive that message as well. The messages need to be ordered and delivered exactly once. All messages on Slack are persisted.</p><p>We have covered the <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2016/09/12/slacks-architecture-with-keith-adams/">architecture</a> and <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2016/09/23/slack-security-with-ryan-huber/">security model</a> of Slack in previous shows. In today’s show, Keith Adams returns to discuss how messages are processed and broadcast in Slack. The problem of Slack’s messaging system is similar to the distributed systems problem of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_broadcast">atomic broadcast</a>”, in which a single process broadcasts a message which needs to be received by all other processes correctly–or else received by none of them.</p><p>In Keith’s last show, he talked through the benefits of building a large system on PHP. He worked on infrastructure at Facebook, which was also a PHP application. It’s worth noting that both Slack and Facebook have scaled a monolithic architecture.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Engineers can build applications faster by using tools that abstract away infrastructure. Major cloud providers offer this tooling in the form of functions-as-a-service, as well as managed services such as Google BigQuery or Azure Container Instances.</p><p>The term “serverless” refers to these functions-as-a-service and the managed services–because when you use these tools, you are not making calls to specific servers–you are making calls to APIs that abstract away the servers from you, while guaranteeing uptime and reliability. In previous shows we have covered Heroku, Firebase, serverless functions, serverless event driven application development, and a few startups that are built almost entirely on serverless infrastructure.</p><p>“Serverless” is a way of describing backend services that are represented by an API. But what about the rest of the application stack that you use to build on top of serverless? You still need to use JavaScript to define the custom code of your application. You still need to use HTML markup to describe the look and feel of your application.</p><p>The “JAM Stack” is a way of building applications consisting of JavaScript, APIs, and markup. Phil Hawksworth is the head of developer relations at Netlify, and he joins the podcast to explain how these JAM Stack applications are developed and deployed, and how developers can use the JAM stack to rapidly build new systems.</p><p>We recently launched a new podcast: Fintech Daily! Fintech Daily is about payments, cryptocurrencies, trading, and the intersection between finance and technology. You can find it on <a href="http://fintechdaily.co/">fintechdaily.co</a> or Apple and Google podcasts. We are looking for other hosts who want to participate.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Cryptocurrencies enable a large number of applications. Trustless reputation systems, decentralized identity tools, micropayments, non-fungible Internet items, borderless currencies, just to name a few. But cryptocurrencies have not yet impacted daily life, for most of us. Why is that?</p><p>One reason is that it is still very hard for developers to build within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The programming languages, such as Solidity, are not widely used by software engineers. Building and deploying smart contracts is not as easy as deploying a simple Ruby on Rails webapp. The open source tooling is immature, as are the paid developer tools.</p><p>Sean Li is the CEO of Fortmatic, a company that is building tools to improve the Ethereum developer experience. Fortmatic simplifies wallet creation, user identity management, security, and money transfer for Ethereum developers.</p><p>Before starting Fortmatic, Sean was the founder of Kitematic, a company that made the developer experience of Docker easier. Kitematic was acquired by Docker. Sean is one of the few people with significant experience in both the enterprise container ecosystem and the cryptocurrency ecosystem.</p><p>Sean joins the show to discuss his time in the Docker ecosystem, his new company Fortmatic, and his perspective on how to build tools for developers. Someday there will be hundreds of thousands of developers building applications around cryptocurrencies, just like people use cloud computing today.  The road to getting there is unclear, and Sean provides useful insights and predictions for the future.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>The word “microservices” started getting used after a series of events–companies were moving to cloud virtual machines. Those VMs got broken up into containers, and the containers can fit to the size of the service. Services that are more narrowly defined take up smaller containers, and can be packed more densely into the virtual machines–hence the term “microservices.”</p><p>As this change to software architecture has occurred, the DevOps movement has encouraged organizations to have better relationships between development and operations. Continuous deployment leads to fewer painful outages. Improved monitoring tools make it easier for developers to take on some of the pain that was previously centralized in operations.</p><p>Several months ago, I attended the <a href="https://www.microservices.com/">Microservices Practitioner Summit</a>, which brings together engineers who are working with microservices at their companies. The conference was organized by Austin Gunter and Richard Li of Datawire. In this episode, they joined me for a conversation about microservices.</p><p>Software Engineering Daily is having our third Meetup, Wednesday May 3rd at Galvanize in San Francisco.

A popular open source project will be contributed to and used by thousands of developers, who are continuously testing, deploying, and improving the software. The open source movement has created massive communities and a thriving, collaborative economy.</p><p>Infrastructure software companies are increasingly built within an open source business model. Databases, queueing systems, orchestrators, operating systems, and search engines have been started as freely available open source projects, and leveraged into billion dollar businesses. In previous shows we have talked about <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/10/18/open-source-product-strategy-with-shaun-connolly/">business strategy</a>, <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/09/07/go-to-market-with-mitch-ferguson/">go-to-market tactics</a>, and licensing of infrastructure software.</p><p>There remains plenty of room for more open source infrastructure companies. We still need better databases and distributed systems management. But over time, open source will move up the stack. From Netflix to Uber to social networks to payments systems–all software verticals will become open source because the benefits of making your software open source outweigh the costs. </p><p>For many software business models, the competitive advantage is not found in their source code–it’s in their data, their network effects, their sales strategy, and their brand. </p><p>Therefore, it makes sense that someday the source code will be freely available, democratizing the infrastructure concerns and letting these software businesses move up the value chain and become less operationally intensive at the bottom of the stack. Rather than asking “why should we open source our code”, these companies will be asking “why shouldn’t we open source our code?”</p><p>Joseph Jacks is the founder of OSS Capital, a venture capital firm that invests exclusively in commercial OSS startup companies. Joe believes that over time, open source eats everything. In today’s show, we talk about the future of open source businesses, the impact of licensing, cloud providers, and cryptocurrencies.</p>',

More sophisticated static analysis tools can be used to analyze code in sensitive domains like healthcare or automobiles.</p><p>During static analysis, we can discover problems in the code by evaluating the structure of a program. Buffer overruns can be identified before they turn into a vulnerability like Heartbleed. Null pointer exceptions can be fixed before they cause a segmentation fault. Concurrency issues can be serialized before they result in a problematic race condition. </p><p>Today’s guest Paul Anderson is the VP of engineering at GrammaTech, where he works on CodeSonar, a static analysis tool. We discussed how static analysis works, why it is useful, and how it fits into a modern software delivery pipeline. Full disclosure: GrammaTech is a sponsor of Software Engineering Daily.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Google Docs is used by millions of people to collaborate on documents together. With today’s technology, you could spend a weekend coding and build a basic version of a collaborative text editor. But in 2004 it was not so easy. </p><p>In 2004 Steve Newman built a product called Writely, which allowed users to collaborate on documents together. Initially, Writely was hosted on a single server that Steve managed himself. All of the reads and writes to the documents went through that single server. Writely rapidly grew in popularity, and Steve went through a crash course in distributed systems as he tried to keep up with the user base.</p><p>In 2006, Writely was acquired by Google, and Steve spent his next four years turning Writely into Google Docs. Eventually he moved onto other projects within Google—“Cosmo” and “Megastore Replication.” When Steve left the company in 2010, he took with him the lessons of logging and monitoring that keep Google’s infrastructure observable.</p><p>Large organizations have terabytes of log data to manage. This data streams off the servers that are running our applications. That log data gets processed in a “metrics pipeline” and turned into monitoring data. Monitoring data aggregates log data in a more presentable format. </p><p>Most of the log messages that get created will never be seen with human eyes. These logs get aggregated into metrics, then compressed, and (in many cases) eventually thrown away. Different companies have different sensitivity around their logs, so some companies may not garbage collect any of their logs!</p><p>When a problem occurs in our infrastructure, we need to be able to dig into our terabytes of log data and quickly find the root cause of a problem. If our log data is compressed and stored on disk, it will take longer to access it. But if we keep all of our logs in memory, it could get expensive.</p><p>To review: if I want to build a logging system from scratch today I need to build: a metrics pipeline for converting log data into monitoring data; a complicated caching system, a way to store and compress logs; a query engine that knows how to ask questions to the log storage system; a user interface so I don’t have to inspect these logs via command line…</p><p>The list of requirements goes on and on—which is why there is a huge industry around log management. And logging keeps evolving!  One example we covered recently is distributed tracing, which is used to diagnose requests that travel through multiple endpoints.</p><p>After Steve Newman left Google, he started Scalyr, a product that allows developers to consume, store, and query log messages. I was looking forward to talking to Steve about data engineering, and the query engine that Scalyr has architected, but we actually spent most of our conversation talking about the early days of Writely, and his time at Google—particularly the operational challenges of Google’s infrastructure.

When a user opens the DoorDash app, the user can search for types of food or specific restaurants from the search bar or they can scroll through the feed section and look at recommendations that the app gives them within their local geographic area.</p><p>Recommendations is a classic computer science problem. Much like sorting, or mapping, or scheduling, we will probably never “solve” recommendations. We will adapt our recommendation systems based off of discoveries in computer science and software engineering.</p><p>One pattern that has been utilized recently by software engineers in many different areas is the “word2vec”-style strategy of embedding entities in a vector space and then finding relationships between them. If you have never heard of the word2vec algorithm, <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/12/28/word2vec-with-adrian-colyer-holiday-repeat/">you can listen to the episode we did with computer scientist and venture capitalist Adrian Colyer</a> or listen to this episode in which we will describe the algorithm with a few brief examples.</p><p>Store2vec is a strategy used by DoorDash to model restaurants in vector space and find relationships between them in order to generate recommendations.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Google Brain is an engineering team focused on deep learning research and applications. One growing area of interest within Google Brain is that of generative models. A generative model uses neural networks and a large data set to create new data similar to the ones that the network has seen before. </p><p>One approach to making use of generative models is GANs: generative adversarial networks. GANs can use a generative model (which creates new examples) together with a discriminator model (which can classify examples). </p><p>As an example, let’s take the task of generating new pictures of cats. We want an artificial cat picture generator. First, we train a discriminator by feeding it billions of example pictures of cats. We now have a model that can tell what a cat is. Next, we make a model that generates completely random images. We feed those randomly generated images to the discriminator. The discriminator outputs a “loss” for these random images. Loss is a metric we can use to represent how far off a given image is from being something that the discriminator would recognize as a cat. Finally, you can feed this “loss” back into the generative model, so that the generative model will adjust its weights in a way that will reduce loss. Over time, the generator gets better and better at reducing loss, until the discriminator starts believing that some of these semi-random images are actually cats.</p><p>Generative model systems have produced useful applications, such as object detection, image editing, and text-to-image generation. Today’s guest Doug Eck works on the Magenta team at Google Brain. Magenta uses applications of deep learning to produce tools and experiments around music, art, and creativity.</p><p><a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2017/05/01/google-brain-music-generation-with-doug-eck/">In a previous show, Doug described his vision for humans and computers to work together on creative tasks such as music.</a> Today, we dive into some of the core machine learning building blocks that make machine creativity possible.</p>',

The approval process for app stores makes it difficult to deploy quickly and iterate in small batches for developers who are making native apps. These frictions cause fewer developers to write mobile apps than we would have if the smartphone platform was unified.</p><p>Since the early days of the smartphone, different cross platform solutions have been tried, and many developers got burned after they implemented an app that was supposed to work on iOS and Android, when the performance ended up being poor on both. Today, the cross-platform solutions are finally getting good with frameworks like React Native and Ionic.</p><p>Ionic allows developers to write apps in AngularJS and deploy them to both Android and iOS.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>A large sales organization has hundreds of sales people. Each of those sales people manages a set of accounts who they are trying to close sales deals on. Sales people are overseen by managers who ensure that the sales people are performing well. Directors and VPs ensure the scalability and health of the overall sales organization.</p><p>The sales lifecycle mostly takes place within a piece of software called a CRM: customer relationship management. This tool documents the interactions between sales people and accounts. CRMs have been around for many years, and although CRM software is a useful repository of data, it does not fulfill all the needs of a salesperson.</p><p>People.ai is a system of machine learning tools built around the sales tooling ecosystem. People.ai helps a sales organization avoid manual data entry, understand areas of potential improvement, and decide on who the highest value sales lead to pursue might be. Andrey Akselrod is the CTO At People.ai and he joins the show to discuss the potential applications of machine learning in the domain of sales, and the engineering work that his company has done.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>An alert is a signal of problematic application behavior. When something unusual happens to your application, an alert can bring that anomaly to your attention. In order to detect unusual events, you need to define the norm. </p><p>In order to define both normal and problematic behavior, you need metrics. Metrics are measurements of the behavior in your application. Metrics get created from logs and other data. These high volumes of data get aggregated and collected into easily digestible metrics. This aggregation process that reduces data to metrics is often called a “metrics pipeline.”</p><p>Clement Pang is the chief architect of Wavefront, a company that builds metrics and alerting software for enterprises such as Box and Lyft. Clement joins the show to discuss how enterprises use alerting and metrics and how to build a company around metrics and alerting–including the data engineering involved in constructing a metrics pipeline.</p><p>The iOS app is the first project to come out of the Software Engineering Daily Open Source Project.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Enterprises want to update their technology faster. One way an enterprise can accelerate the adoption of new tools is to move more aggressively towards the cloud. By giving internal developers access to the cloud, it becomes easier to provision new servers–allowing for rapid experimentation, test environments, and scalability. </p><p>In previous shows we have explored how large enterprises successfully learn to move their technology faster. Much of this process is rooted in being able to experiment quickly–which requires well-defined testing procedures, and the ability to quickly provision and destroy infrastructure.</p><p>Many enterprises have large on-premise infrastructure deployments. An enterprise’s movement towards the cloud can be made complex by this existing set of servers.</p><p>In today’s show, Aparna Sinha discusses how Kubernetes is useful for enterprises–and how it can improve development speed, experimentation, and observability. Aparna is the leader of the product team for Kubernetes and Container Engine at Google.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>The DAO was a system of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain that investors put millions of dollars into. Back in May 2016, it was the largest crowdfunding event in history, and we discussed it in detail in a <a href="https://www.softwaredaily.com/post/59b731a5faa03a3fb5481329/DAO-Hack-with-Matt-Leising">previous episode with Matt Leising</a>. The DAO was hacked due to a security vulnerability, and this event led to a hard fork of Ethereum.</p><p>The DAO was organized by a company called Slock.it. Slock.it’s original goal was to allow people to connect devices to the Ethereum blockchain. If you could connect smart locks, cars, and electricity systems to the blockchain, it could create decentralized systems for sharing these devices. To raise money, Slock.it created the DAO. Although the initial scope of the DAO was to raise money for Slock.it, over time it expanded in scope to become a decentralized system for venture capital.</p><p>When the DAO was hacked, the events that followed shook the Ethereum community. The hard fork lowered the financial damage inflicted on the investors–but there was still outrage within the community. How was it possible for an open source crowdfunding project to launch with a security vulnerability? As the Ethereum world looked for someone to blame, they turned to Slock.it.</p><p>Thus began a very difficult period in the life of Christoph Jentzsch. Christoph is the CEO of Slock.it, and he has been involved in the Ethereum community since the early days. When people think of Slock.it, they might imagine a group of people that move fast and break things. But in fact, Christoph’s early work on Ethereum was around rigorous unit testing of different Ethereum clients. He was obsessed with testing, and consistency between the different Ethereum interfaces.</p><p>In today’s episode, Christoph and I talk about his early experiences with Ethereum, his reflections on the events of the DAO, and the direction that Slock.it is going today. Since the events of the DAO, the company has refocused its efforts on the original mission–to connect devices to the Ethereum blockchain.</p><p>Meetups for Software Engineering Daily are being planned!

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>When a patient comes into the hospital with stroke symptoms, the hospital will give that patient a CAT scan, a 3-dimensional imaging of the patient’s brain. The CAT scan needs to be examined by a radiologist, and the radiologist will decide whether to refer the patient to an interventionist–a surgeon who can perform an operation to lower the risk of long-term damage to the patient’s brain function.</p><p>After getting the CAT scan, the patient might wait for hours before a radiologist has a chance to look at the scan. In that period of time, the patient’s brain function might be rapidly degrading. To speed up this workflow, a company called Viz.ai built a machine learning model that can recognize whether a patient is at high risk of stroke consequences or not.</p><p>Many people have predicted that radiologists will be automated away by machine learning in the coming years. This episode presents a much more realistic perspective: first of all, we don’t have nearly enough radiologists, so if we can create automated radiologists that would be a very good thing; second of all, even in this workflow with a cutting-edge machine learning radiologist, you still need the human radiologist in the loop.</p><p>David Golan is the CTO at Viz.ai, and in today’s show he explains why he is working on a system for automated stroke identification, and the engineering challenges in building that system.</p><p>Transcript provided by We Edit Podcasts.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Over the last decade, computation and storage has moved from on-premise hardware into the cloud data center. Instead of having large servers “on premise,” companies started to outsource their server workloads to cloud service providers.</p><p>At the same time, there has been a proliferation of devices at the “edge.” The most common edge device is your smartphone, but there are many other smart devices that are growing in number–drones, smart cars, Nest thermostats, smart refrigerators, IoT sensors, and next generation centrifuges. Each of these devices contains computational hardware.</p><p>Another class of edge device is the edge server. Edge servers are used to facilitate faster response times than your core application. For example, Software Engineering Daily uses a content delivery network for audio files. These audio files are distributed throughout the world on edge servers. The core application logic of Software Engineering Daily runs on a WordPress site, and that WordPress application is distributed to far fewer servers than our audio files.</p><p>“Cloud computing” and “edge computing” both refer to computers that can serve requests. The “edge” is commonly used to refer to devices that are closer to the user–so they will deliver faster responses. The “cloud” refers to big, bulky servers that can do heavy duty processing workloads–such as training machine learning models, or issuing a large distributed MapReduce query.</p><p>As the volume of computation and data increases, we look for better ways to utilize our resources, and we are realizing that the devices at the edge are underutilized. </p><p>In today’s episode, Kenton Varda explains how and why to deploy application logic to the edge. He works at Cloudflare on a project called Cloudflare Workers, which are a way to deploy JavaScript to edge servers, such as the hundreds of data centers around the world that are used by Cloudflare for caching.</p><p>Kenton was previously on the show to discuss protocol buffers, a project he led while he was at Google.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Amazon Web Services is the leading cloud provider by a large margin. Amazon established its lead by being first to market in 2006, with Google and Microsoft taking several years to catch up to the huge business opportunity of the cloud.</p><p>Since 2008, Google Cloud has been working on cloud products for developers. It started with App Engine, which is widely used internally at Google, but has not had overwhelming public adoption. Over the last eleven years, Google has refined its understanding of how customers want to buy public cloud resources. Google Cloud products like Cloud Storage, Persistent Disk, and BigTable have given Google parity with many of the AWS public cloud offerings.</p><p>Although Google has caught up to AWS in terms of products, the enterprise market has continued to choose AWS as its default. AWS is widely perceived as  having more experience in running enterprise workloads, and a better responsiveness to customers.</p><p>In order to keep Amazon from running away with the cloud market entirely, Google needed to shift the competitive landscape to different territory. Kubernetes provided the paradigm shift that Google needed.</p><p>The market for cloud providers has changed completely due to Kubernetes. When Google open sourced Kubernetes, it created a common codebase for software companies to build software for managing distributed systems. </p><p>In the span of five years, Kubernetes has turned the world of cloud products into a world resembling the open source Linux ecosystem. This is a remarkable shift, and every infrastructure software vendor is still figuring out its strategy for adapting.</p><p>Adam Glick is the head of modern infrastructure and serverless marketing at Google. With Craig Box, he hosts the Kubernetes Podcast from Google, an excellent show about recent developments and evergreen concepts within the world of Kubernetes. Prior to Google, Adam worked at AWS for 3 years and Microsoft for twelve years. He has seen each of the major cloud providers up close and has a deep awareness for how each company thinks.</p><p>We had a great conversation about the cloud native landscape, podcasting, and developer marketing.</p><p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/software-engineering-daily/id1253734426?mt=8">New Software Daily app for iOS</a>.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Playing a video on the Internet seems simple. You press play, the video gets delivered, and boom–you are watching Game of Thrones, right?</p><p>It’s a bit more complicated. Unless you have built an application that involves video, you probably have not dealt with the world of codecs, bitrates, and streaming. Depending on the bandwidth between the user and the server, you might want to use different compression rates. Think about all of the different use cases–different connection speeds, device types, operating systems, video players, cloud providers. As a developer, you just want videos in your application to play quickly and reliably. But it takes a lot of engineering, monitoring, and re-engineering to get it right.</p><p>Matt McClure and Jon Dahl are the founders of Mux, a company that makes video infrastructure technologies. Previously they built Zencoder, a product for encoding and delivering video. This episode was a fascinating discussion of why building video products for the modern Internet is still so hard. </p><p>Download <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/software-engineering-daily-podcast-app/id1253734426?mt=8">the Software Engineering Daily app for iOS</a> to hear all of our old episodes, and easily discover new topics that might interest you.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Thumbtack is a marketplace for real-world services. On Thumbtack, people get their house painted, their dog walked, and their furniture assembled. With 40,000 daily marketplace transactions, the company handles significant traffic. </p><p>On yesterday’s episode, we explored how one aspect of Thumbtack’s marketplace recently changed, going from asynchronous matching to synchronous “instant” matching. In this episode, we zoom out to the larger architecture of Thumbtack, and how the company has grown through its adoption of managed services from both AWS and Google Cloud.</p><p>The word “serverless” has a few definitions. In the context of today’s episode, serverless is all about managed services like Google BigQuery, Google Cloud PubSub, and Amazon ECS. The majority of infrastructure at Thumbtack is built using services that automatically scale up and down. Application deployment, data engineering, queueing, and databases are almost entirely handled by cloud providers.</p><p>For the most part, Thumbtack is a “serverless” company. And it makes sense–if you are building a high-volume marketplace, you are not in the business of keeping servers running. You are in the business of improving your matching algorithms, your user experience, and your overall architecture. Paying for lots of managed services is more expensive than running virtual machines–but Thumbtack saves money from not having to hire site reliability engineers.</p><p>Nate Kupp leads the technical infrastructure team, and we met at QCon in San Francisco to talk about how to architect a modern marketplace. This was my third time attending QCon and as always I was impressed by the quality of presentations and conversations I had there. They were also kind enough to set up some dedicated space for podcasters like myself.</p><p>The most widely used cloud provider is AWS, but more and more companies that come on the show are starting to use some of the managed services from Google. The great news for developers is that integration between these managed services is pretty easy.</p><p>At Thumbtack, the production infrastructure on AWS serves user requests. The log of transactions that occur get pushed from AWS to Google Cloud, where the data engineering occurs. On Google Cloud, the transaction records are queued in Cloud PubSub, a message queueing service. Those transactions are pulled off the queue and stored in BigQuery, a system for storage and querying of high volumes of data.</p><p>BigQuery is used as the data lake to pull from when orchestrating machine learning jobs. These machine learning jobs are run in Cloud Dataproc, a managed service that runs Apache Spark. After training a model in Google Cloud, that model is deployed on the AWS side, where it serves user traffic. On the Google Cloud side, the orchestration of these different managed services is done by Apache Airflow, an open source tool that is one of the few pieces of infrastructure that Thumbtack does have to manage themselves on Google Cloud.</p><p>To find out more about the Thumbtack infrastructure, check out the video of the talk Nate gave at QCon San Francisco, or check out the <a href="https://www.thumbtack.com/engineering/">Thumbtack Engineering Blog</a>.</p><p>Transcript provided by We Edit Podcasts.

Some people today interact with voice interfaces, augmented reality, virtual reality, and automotive computer screens like the Tesla. In the future, these other interfaces will become more common. Developers will want to be able to expose their applications to these new interfaces.</p><p>For example, let’s say I am a developer who builds a podcast playing app. I have a website and a mobile app, but what if I want to expose that app to a voice interface? Or, what if I want to expose a specific piece of functionality from that app, to make shortcuts easier?</p><p>Android Slices are user interface components that expose pieces of application functionality to Google Search, Google Assistant, and other applications. Jason Monk is a software engineer who works on Android Slices at Google. Jason joins the show to discuss how mobile user interfaces are changing, the motivation behind Android Slices, and the engineering behind this newer building block for Android developers.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>NoSQL databases provide an interface for storing and accessing data that allows the user to work with data in an “unstructured” fashion. SQL databases require the data in the database to be “normalized,” meaning that each object in the entire database has an entry (or a null value) for each field. One advantage of NoSQL is that the different objects are “denormalized,” meaning that different objects in the database can have unique fields.</p><p>There is a widely held belief that NoSQL databases do not scale, or that there is some significant penalty that a developer will pay for using a NoSQL database as soon as their app becomes popular. The truth is much more subtle than that. </p><p>NoSQL databases can perform as well as or better than SQL databases if the developers know the query patterns that their applications make. SQL databases will be a better choice in the condition where the database has a very wide spectrum of access patterns. But in many cases, an application has a narrow range of different requests for the database, and a NoSQL database can perform very well if the database is structured and optimized for these requests.</p><p>Rick Houlihan is an executive with Amazon Web Services who works with database teams and engineers to optimize their products and database infrastructure. Rick joins the show to discuss the tenets of NoSQL and describe the fundamental contrast between NoSQL and SQL database limitations.</p>',

When Neha Narkhede was at LinkedIn, she helped develop Kafka, which was deployed at LinkedIn to help solve this very problem. Using Kafka as an event queue, LinkedIn adopted the CQRS architectural pattern together with event sourcing.</p><p>Event sourcing is an architectural pattern that allows changes to our application model to be represented as events. Each event is published to an event queue, and is pulled off of the queue by each of the various services that need to consume that event.

A website goes down in the middle of the night, and the outage triggers a phone call to an engineer who has to wake up and fix the problem. Other problems can be significantly larger. When a major problem occurs, it can cause millions of dollars in losses and requires hours of work to fix.</p><p>When software unexpectedly breaks, it is called an incident. To triage these incidents, an engineer uses a combination of tools, including Slack, GitHub, cloud providers, and continuous deployment systems. These different tools emit updates that can be received by an incident response platform, which allow the on-call engineer to have the information they need centralized to more easily work through the incident.</p><p>On-call rotation means that different people will be responsible for dealing with different incidents that occur. When an incident happens, the current engineer who is on-call may not be aware that a similar incident happened last week. It might be easier for the new engineer to triage the issue if they have insights about how the incident was managed during the first time.</p><p>Chris Riley is a DevOps advocate with Splunk. He joins the show to discuss the application of machine learning to incident response. We discuss the different data points that are created during an incident, and how that data can be used to build models for different types of incidents, which can generate information to help the engineer respond appropriately to an incident.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>GraphQL has become a core piece of infrastructure for many software applications. GraphQL is used to make requests that are structured as GraphQL queries and responded to through a GraphQL server. The GraphQL server processes the query and fetches the response from the necessary databases, APIs, and backend services.</p><p>Around 2016, when GraphQL was becoming popular, a company called Meteor was deciding what to do with its business. Meteor was started off of the popular framework MeteorJS, a system for building real-time JavaScript applications. MeteorJS was loved by many developers, but Meteor needed to decide if it was the most viable opportunity that it could be pursuing with its resources. </p><p>From the vantage point within the Meteor company, there were some trends in the frontend ecosystem that were potentially disruptive to the viability of Meteor. There were also some large potential opportunities. The dramatic change to the frontend was largely coming as a downstream effect of Facebook’s open source technologies: React and GraphQL. Amidst these changes, Meteor shifted the company’s efforts entirely towards GraphQL and renamed the company Apollo. </p><p>Geoff Schmidt is the CEO of Apollo, and he joins the show to talk about the GraphQL ecosystem, the business opportunities around GraphQL, and the process of pivoting from Meteor to Apollo.</p><p>If you are planning a hackathon, check out <a href="https://findcollabs.com/hackathon/detail">FindCollabs Hackathons</a>.

Core application servers such as Ruby on Rails are often supported by NGINX, which handles routing the user requests between the different application server instances. </p><p>This model of routing and load balancing between different application instances has matured over the last ten years due to an increase in the number of servers, and an increase in the variety of services. </p><p>A pattern called “<a href="https://www.softwaredaily.com/posts/service-mesh">service mesh</a>” has grown in popularity and is used to embed routing infrastructure closer to individual services by giving them a sidecar proxy. The application sidecars are connected to each other, and requests between any two services are routed through a proxy. These different proxies are managed by a central control plane which manages policies of the different proxies.</p><p>Alan Murphy works at NGINX, and he joins the show to give a brief history of NGINX and how the product has evolved from a reverse proxy and edge routing tool to a service mesh. Alan has worked in the world of load balancing and routing for more than a decade, having been at F5 Networks for many years before F5 acquired NGINX.

On today’s show, we break down the history of dev ops with Demir Selmanovic, the lead technical editor at TopTal.</p><p>From waterfall software development, to the agile manifesto. From lean manufacturing to the productive pinnacle of DevOps nirvana. Demir also wrote a blog post called <a href="https://www.toptal.com/devops/what-the-hell-is-devops">What the Hell is DevOps</a>, which he posted on the TopTal blog. Full disclosure: TopTal is a sponsor of our show, but this episode doesn’t discuss TopTal very much so hopefully that doesn’t impact the trust of our listeners.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Amazon Web Services first came out in 2006.</p><p>It took several years before the software industry realized that cloud computing was a transformative piece of technology. Initially, the common perspective around cloud computing was that it was a useful tool for startups, but would not be a smart option for large, established businesses. Cloud computing was not considered economical nor secure.</p><p>Today, that has changed. Every company that writes software is figuring out how to utilize the cloud. Software companies with on-prem servers are migrating old applications to the cloud, and most companies that have started in the last decade do not even have physical servers. </p><p>Applications that are started on the cloud are referred to as “cloud-native.” The architecture of cloud-native applications is a newer topic of discussion, and some software patterns that became established in the pre-cloud era make less sense today.</p><p>Cornelia Davis is VP of technology at Pivotal and the author of <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/cloud-native-patterns">Cloud Native Patterns</a>, a book about developing applications in the distributed, virtual world of the cloud.

Building a development environment in the browser has numerous technical challenges. How does the code execute safely? How do you fit all of the requirements of a development environment into a browser window? How do you get users to switch from their normal IDE (interactive development environment)?</p><p>CodeSandbox is an online code editor created by Ives van Hoorne and Bas Buursma. CodeSandbox allows users to program and run applications in the browser. It is a full developer platform that allows users the ability to install npm modules, run their code, and share their applications with other users.</p><p>The engineering problems within CodeSandbox are not easy–building a web-based IDE is complicated. But CodeSandbox is also an exciting project because it lowers the barrier to entry for many newer programmers. The development experience for a new programmer is still a difficult onramp.</p><p>If you are an experienced developer, you have a workflow that you are comfortable with. It might involve vim, or emacs, or JetBrains IDEs, or Eclipse. But newer developers can find these environments confusing and hard to get started with. The development environments of today are integrated with build tools, Github repositories, and deployment platforms. This can be overwhelming for a newer developer.</p><p>CodeSandbox is a very visual tool, which makes it especially useful for new developers who learn through seeing examples running live in the browser. CodeSandbox is also used by web developers who want a modern, shareable form of developing software.</p><p>Ives and Bas join the show to talk about the motivation for CodeSandbox and the engineering challenges they have solved.</p>',

The relational model has existed for decades, but the requirements for a relational database have changed.</p><p>Modern applications have requirements for high volumes of data that do not fit onto a single machine. When a database gets too big to fit on a single machine, that database needs to be sharded into smaller subsets of the data. These database shards are spread across multiple machines, and as the database grows, the database can be resharded to scale to even more machines.</p><p>To ensure durability, a database needs to be replicated. The database needs to be able to survive any single machine losing power or getting destroyed.</p><p>Sharding and replication allow a relational database to be scalable, durable, and highly available. There are many ways to build sharding and replication into a database.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p><em>Photo credit: Elisabeth Fall</em></p><p>Ben Horowitz started Loudcloud with Marc Andreessen in 1999. He ran the company for eight years and chronicled his experience in his first book The Hard Thing About Hard Things.</p><p>In his time running Loudcloud, the dotcom bubble burst, but Loudcloud needed cash so badly that he took the company public in 2001. Loudcloud went through layoffs, downsizing, and a difficult strategic maneuver in which Loudcloud sold its cloud provider business for cash, then used the core competency it had developed to create new software for building and running cloud services. This new software was the core product of the company Opsware, which was sold to HP in 2007 for $1.6bn.</p><p>The Loudcloud story looks like a rational, straightforward execution in retrospect, but at many points in the timeline, Ben was unsure he was making the correct decision. As the subtitle of his first book states “there are no easy answers.” </p><p>The Hard Thing About Hard Things tells the story of Loudcloud and Opsware in harrowing detail. Most founders of software companies will end up reading the book at some point when they are building their company, because there are so few books which capture the granular details of what it feels like to run a company.</p><p>A CEO is completely alone in their understanding of the company. Nobody else has nearly as much information as the CEO–not the board, not the market, and not the employees. When you are a CEO, there is simply nobody to turn to who can give you the actionable advice that you wish you could have access to. And because there is nobody else, it means that the CEO’s own psychological state is extremely important.</p><p>The Hard Thing About Hard Things provides a CEO with solace: while the CEO is alone within their company, they are not alone in the world. Every CEO has a set of issues which they have never faced before, and the CEO can learn to face those issues confidently and competently. </p><p>Like any influential book, The Hard Thing About Hard Things presents the reader with useful answers, but also raises many questions. How can a normal person foster the mentality of a leader? How can a leader convince smart people to follow their direction? How can a seemingly crazy direction be framed as completely rational?</p><p>The second book by Ben Horowitz is called What You Do Is Who You Are. This book surveys a set of case studies in leadership, including a Haitian slave revolt, the Mongol empire, and a dominant prison gang. By studying violent environments, Ben frames leadership in the context of the highest stakes. </p><p>These stories are about life and death. When a leader’s performance is measured in blood, it frames the true nature of leadership in the starkest resolution. Ben uses each distilled example as a base case which inducts into broader applications: the cultures of Netflix, Facebook, Uber, and McDonalds are explored alongside editorials about Hillary Clinton and hip hop culture.</p><p>Throughout all of these stories, the most important thread is continually reinforced: the leader creates the culture. The culture is the leader. What you do is who you are.</p><p>Ben joins the show to discuss his writing, and how he has applied these beliefs to Andreessen Horowitz, the venture capital firm he co-founded and leads today.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Nubank is a popular bank that is based in Brazil. Nubank has more than 20 million customers, and has accumulated a high volume of data over the six years since it was started.</p><p><a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2020/01/30/whats-behind-the-rise-of-challenger-banks/">Mobile computing and cloud computing have given rise to “challenger banks”</a> that operate more like software companies. When a software company reaches the size that Nubank is at today, it needs a data platform.</p><p>A data platform is a collection of different technologies that move data into different storage formats and applications, so that different members of an organization can access that data. New data often enters an organization through an OLTP database, which supports user transactions. That data is copied into a data lake, which provides cheap bulk storage. From the data lake, the data is moved into a data warehouse system for fast access. Along the way, tools like Kafka, Spark, and S3 are used to implement the needs of the data platform.</p><p>Data platform architecture is not an exact science. Different companies build their data platform based on their own unique requirements. Previous shows have covered the data infrastructure companies like Lyft, Uber, and Facebook. Today’s show is another case study in data infrastructure, with a modern bank.</p><p>In a previous episode, we covered the engineering of Nubank. Sujith Nair from Nubank joins today’s show to talk about the data infrastructure of the company. </p><p>If you enjoy the show, you can find all of our past episodes about data infrastructure by going to <a href="https://www.softwaredaily.com/">SoftwareDaily.com</a> and searching for the technologies or companies mentioned.

Animations can be seen in messaging apps, where animated reactions can convey rich feelings over a text interface. Loading screens can become less boring through animation, and voice assistant products can feel more alive through animation.</p><p>But we still don’t see much animation in our everyday applications. This is partly because animation tooling is difficult to use. To make an animation, the typical workflow is to go into a tool like After Effects, render your animation, and then export that animation in a movie format. This format is not dynamic enough to be easily used on the wide variety of development platforms.</p><p>The animation library Lottie did improve this tooling by creating a system for exporting animations to JSON and allowing them to easily scale up and down as vectors. But the animations still were simple and unidirectional. The developer did not have much freedom for how to move an animation in response to user input.</p><p>Rive is a system for creating dynamic, movable animated objects. Rive allows for the creation of animated elements that respond to user input. Rive has a tool that runs in the browser and allows the user to define the animation. </p><p>The animations in Rive use a bone system that allows animators and designers to define the points of the animated sprite that the developer can then manipulate with code. This improves the painful handoff process that exists between animators and developers, and gives the developer some programmatic control.</p><p>Guido and Luigi Rosso are the founders of Rive and they join the show to talk about the frictions of animation tooling, and what they have built to improve</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Cloud infrastructure is usually consumed in the form of virtual machines or containers. These VMs or containers are running on a physical host machine that is also running other VMs and containers. This is called multitenancy. Servers across cloud providers such as AWS have a high utilization because there are multiple virtual instances running on each physical server host.</p><p>Cloud computing has led to a low cost of compute infrastructure. But in some cases, this low cost comes at the price of not being able to control the underlying hardware with as much precision as the user would want. Some users want specific types of hardware.

At some point in the future, perhaps cryptocurrencies can be used as a global medium of exchange that is accepted at the grocery store. Perhaps we will use the blockchain for supply chain management, and as a universal ledger for real estate ownership.</p><p>But today, cryptocurrencies are mostly used for speculative trading. Users buy and sell different cryptocurrencies and stablecoins, looking to make short-term profits. And the markets for trading cryptocurrencies have evolved to have a sophistication that looks like the centralized markets of derivatives and leverage-based day trading.</p><p>The term “decentralized finance” refers to this phenomenon of cryptocurrency lending markets. Decentralized finance increases the volume of speculated capital by providing liquidity through smart contracts. This short-term liquidity is often collateralized by a volatile cryptocurrency such as Ethereum, creating an opportunity for a type of market participant called a “liquidator.”</p><p>Tom Schmidt is an investor with Dragonfly Capital, a cryptoasset investment firm.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>The vision of code-free programming has existed for decades. Software engineers have always dreamed of empowering non-technical users with the same creative tools that programmers have access to. </p><p>For many years, the underlying technology of the web was not powerful enough to make this dream a reality. Platforms such as WordPress, Squarespace, and Wix have allowed for some of the functionality of programming without writing code, but the scope of what those tools could accomplish was limited.</p><p>Today, the web has caught up. Improvements in browser technology and client devices mean that the end user has access to more powerful technology. The API economy encapsulates large amounts of functionality into cheap, well-defined functionality. No-code platforms are finding success among developers and non-developers, after persisting for several years as their technology matured.</p><p>Bubble is a code-free platform for building websites, startups, and internal tools. Emmanuel Straschnov and Joshua Haas are the founders of Bubble, and they join the show to tell the story of Bubble, and give their perspective on engineering, business, and the low-code movement. </p><p>The story of Bubble is strikingly similar to that of no-code tools <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2019/05/10/airtable-with-howie-liu/">Airtable</a> and <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2019/10/11/webflow-no-code-with-vlad-magdolin/">Webflow</a>, which we have covered in previous episodes. All of these products have taken years to get to maturity, with no shortcuts–only gritty, difficult engineering problems and performance improvements. Each of these no-code platforms has an inspiring story behind them, and persistent founders who eventually got their product to success.</p>',

Anyone can use OpenStreetMap to add maps to their application. The data in OpenStreetMap is crowdsourced by users who submit updates to the OpenStreetMap database. Since anyone can submit data to OpenStreetMap, there is a potential for bad data to appear in the system.</p><p>Facebook uses OpenStreetMap for its mapping data, including for important applications where bad data would impact a map user in a meaningfully negative way.

Remote desktop is a functionality that many engineers use every day, so it is surprising that the open source world has taken awhile to displace the functionality of proprietary software.<br>\nIn 2010, Mike Jumper started working on Guacamole, a way to access remote desktops through your browser. Over the last six years, Mike has worked continuously to create a simple, open-source software tool to access desktops remotely, and this year Guacamole joined the Apache Incubator and became Apache Guacamole.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Cloud computing started to become popular in 2006 with the release of Amazon EC2, a system for deploying applications to virtual machines sitting on remote data center infrastructure . With cloud computing, application developers no longer needed to purchase expensive server hardware. Creating an application for the Internet became easier, cheaper, and simpler.</p><p>As the cloud has become popular, new ways of deploying applications have emerged. A developer with a web app has so many different options.</p><p>You can host your app on an Amazon EC2 server, which will require you to manage cloud infrastructure in case your server crashes. You can deploy your app to Heroku, which gives your cloud deployment better uptime guarantees for a higher price than Amazon EC2. Or you can use Linode, or Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud.</p><p>There is such a large market for cloud computing that the world of cloud providers serves more niches every year. In past episodes we have explored a variety of different cloud providers, and the markets they target.</p><p>Pivotal Cloud Foundry is for managing complex distributed systems applications, typically with large teams. Firebase is a cloud provider that simplifies the developer experience for applications with small teams. Spotinst is a cloud provider that emphasizes low cost. Zeit is a cloud provider that is built to manage applications through serverless “functions-as-a-service” like AWS Lambda.</p><p>In today’s episode, Mathias Biilman Christensen, CEO of Netlify, joins the show. Netlify is a cloud provider that was built for modern web projects. Netlify represents the convergence of several trends in software development converging: static site deployment, serverless functions, a desire to have a “no-ops” deployment with minimal management, and the rise of newer tools like GraphQL and Gatsby. </p><p>Mathias explores these trends in detail, and explores the technical challenges of building Netlify. He was a great guest, capable of talking about difficult backend problems that require writing C++, as well as the frontend world of JavaScript frameworks.</p><p>One announcement before we begin: we are having a $5000 hackathon. The $5000 hackathon is for a new product we’ve been working on: <a href="http://findcollabs.com">FindCollabs</a>. FindCollabs is a platform for finding collaborators and building projects. Whether you are an engineer, a musician, a designer, a videographer, or an artist, FindCollabs lets you find people and collaborate. To try out FindCollabs, just go to FindCollabs.com, you can make a project or you can join someone else’s project. And it’s very easy to make these projects–you don’t need to have anything built yet–you need to have a vision for what you want to build. And to find out about the hackathon, go to <a href="http://findcollabs.com/hackathon">findcollabs.com/hackathon</a>. We are giving away $5000 in cash to the coolest projects that get built before Sunday April 14th. So I recommend getting started early, finding some people to collaborate with, and building some cool stuff! </p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Cryptocurrency speculation has pulled in a large population of people who do not know what they are investing in. If you hear about an investment of $1000 turning into $1M, it’s tempting to get sucked in yourself. </p><p>For most of these everyday people, the game is completely rigged. A large percentage of market activity is driven by “pump and dumps.” A pump and dump is a conspiracy to trick investors into buying a currency. </p><p>An insider group commits the pump and dump. This is accomplished by purchasing the currency ahead of time, then promoting it via Twitter, Telegram, and reddit. The outsiders fall victim to the promotion of the currency, and buy it after the fast run-up in value. The currency then crashes, and the outsiders are left “holding the bag.”</p><p>Pump and dumps are not a new phenomenon—they have happened with worthless penny stocks. One thing that is new is the ease with which new cryptocurrencies are being created. Launching an ICO is easy. Marketing it is cheap. Pumping and dumping has never been more accessible. And buying them is quite easy as well. This has led to a perfect storm of naive investment capital.</p><p>Bruno Skvorc is the CEO and owner of Bitfalls, a site with blog posts, news, and information about cryptocurrencies. He wrote a post called “The Anatomy of a Pump and Dump Group,” which details how cryptocurrency pump and dumps have been used to swindle investors out of millions of dollars.</p><p>Meetups for Software Engineering Daily are being planned!

The paper focuses on a survey of 1700 high school and college students, and takes a statistical approach to understanding why women are not pursuing computer science.</p><p>In our conversation, Jennifer talks about the two influences that lead to fewer women in computer science: encouragement and exposure. The problem of encouragement: women often do not receive encouragement to go into computer science. The problem of exposure: women are often unaware that computer science even exists. On this episode, we explore the roots of these problems, and other results of her demographic study of young students.</p>',

This is the era of “web 2.0.”</p><p>With decentralized systems, we are starting to get a feel for what “web 3.0” might feel like. The futuristic idea of “web 3.0” works off of the following idea: instead of using a centralized service owned by a single company, you might purchase your computation and storage from a network of nodes. The nodes will be running peer-to-peer software that competes on price.</p><p>Fabian Vogelsteller works on Web3.js, a JavaScript library for interfacing with the Ethereum blockchain.

A fraudster can set up a website, scrape content from the internet, and run programmatic advertisements against that website. The fraudster can then purchase bot traffic. Those bots will visit the page, consume advertisements, and return profit to the owner of the page.</p><p>In a past life, Shailin Dhar worked for a company that set up these types of advertising fraud schemes. He was fascinated by the industry in the same way that plenty of people get fascinated with the fast-moving market dynamics that are enabled by modern software. But over time, the novelty wore off and Shailin realized how big the fraud problem is and how much it was hurting people.</p><p>In today’s episode Shailin and I discuss how bots and poorly aligned incentives lead to systemic failures and significant financial loss for brands who purchase advertising.</p>',

These projects are key pieces of infrastructure used by thousands of developers–including engineers at Facebook itself. </p><p>These projects are able to gain traction because Facebook takes time to decouple the projects from their internal infrastructure and clean up the code before releasing them into the wild. Facebook has high standards for what they are willing to release.</p><p>Tom Occhino manages the React team at Facebook and works closely with engineers to determine what projects make sense to open source. In this episode, Preethi Kasireddy interviews Tom about how Facebook thinks about open source–what went right with React, why it makes sense for Facebook to continue to release new open source projects, and how full-time employees at Facebook interact with that open source codebase.</p><p>We would love to get your feedback on Software Engineering Daily.

Automated QA tests are scripts that validate correct data representation as the application mechanically runs through high-level workflows–like a login page. Manual QA testers act out use cases of an application to see if there are any bugs that were missed during automated test cases. Manual QA testing is often necessary for complex applications where it is not possible to enumerate all potential workflows within a script.</p><p>Different companies have radically different workflows for QA testing. There are a variety of ticketing systems, testing frameworks, and team chat applications that play a role in a tester’s daily life. QASymphony is a platform for testing tools that integrates with other popular technologies to centralize a QA testing workflow. </p><p>Jonathan Alexander is the CTO at QASymphony.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>React Native allows developers to build native applications for iOS and Android using components written in the React JavaScript framework. These ReactJS components render to native application code by going over a JavaScript bridge, a message bus that communicates between JavaScript code and native iOS or Android runtimes.</p><p>For most mobile application use cases, React Native works well. But in some cases, the platform suffers from performance issues due to the functionality of the JavaScript bridge. For example, mobile games with high demands on graphics, networking, and fast real-time updates to the UI can stutter when using React Native.</p><p>To address the performance issues of React Native, the core team working on React Native at Facebook is rearchitecting the React Native runtime within a project called Fabric. Fabric consists of changes to the threading model, the data handling system, and the JavaScript bridge.</p><p>Chris Severns and Lee Johnson work at G2i, a group of React and React Native specialists. Chris and Lee join the show to discuss the rearchitecture, including the engineering history of React, the technical debt within the React project, and the vision that the React team has for the future.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>GatsbyJS is a framework for building web applications for JavaScript. Gatsby’s original goal was to allow users to create super fast static web sites that could be hosted and served efficiently at a low cost. Most web pages have components from a framework like React or Angular that need to render after the user requests them. This rendering can sometimes require additional requests to external data sources, causing the page to take longer to load.</p><p>Gatsby uses GraphQL to pull in data at build time and pre-render as much of a site as possible using React’s server side rendering. When a page built with Gatsby is served to a user, as much of the page has been rendered as possible, so that the browser can quickly load everything on the page without additional network requests.</p><p>Kyle Mathews is the creator of GatsbyJS. He joins the show to describe why he created Gatsby–the high level goals and low level engineering decisions. We also discuss how Kyle intends to take Gatsby beyond just an open source project and turn it into a business.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>The history of computing can be thought of as a series of ideas rather than objects. From Aristotle’s formalization of the syllogism, to Alan Turing’s model for an all-purpose computing machine, to Satoshi Nakamoto’s distributed transaction ledger–these breakthroughs did not come in the form of polished, tangible objects. In fact, the objects which end up changing computing fundamentally are often built from ideas that seemed trivial at first glance.</p><p>Chris Dixon is a general partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and is the author of the article <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/03/aristotle-computer/518697/">How Aristotle Created the Computer</a>. One job of a venture capitalist is to be early in identifying the ideas that will evolve into influential, tangible objects. In this article, Chris examined several instances in the history of computing where ideas that looked weird and impractical at first glance ended up being world-changing. Recent examples we discussed are blockchains and neural networks.</p><p>Chris recently wrote a <a href="https://medium.com/@cdixon/crypto-tokens-a-breakthrough-in-open-network-design-e600975be2ef">great article about crypto tokens</a>.</p><p>Check out our new <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2017/05/02/new-topic-feeds/">topic feeds</a>, in iTunes or wherever you find your podcasts.

There is an ocean of cloud providers and CRM systems and monitoring platforms and sales prospecting tools.</p><p>The range of available software products is so diverse that it can be overwhelming to figure out which products to buy. Siftery is a company that was started to index software products and help buyers make decisions. Siftery can build a data set from your web site or from your Google account, assess your software stack, and compare those software products to others on the market.</p><p>In a previous show with Ayan Barua, we discussed how engineers should explore the question of build vs. buy. In today’s episode, Ayan joins the show to discuss how Siftery has evolved, and the engineering behind Siftery products. A newer Siftery product called Track can ingest banking transactions, QuickBooks records, or other transaction histories and use that information to compile the cost structure of your software company, and we spent the latter part of our conversation discussing why and how they built it.</p><p>Transcript provided by We Edit Podcasts.

Consul is used for storage of critical cluster information, such as service IP locations and configuration data. A service interacts with Consul via a daemon process on the node of that service. The daemon process periodically shares information with the Consul server over a gossip UDP protocol and can share data on a more immediate basis using TCP.</p><p>Consul’s functionality has increased recently to add secure service connectivity. Consul Connect allows services to establish mutual TLS encryption with each other. The addition of mutual TLS to the Consul feature set is closely incidental with Consul gaining a title of “service mesh.”</p><p>Service mesh is an increasingly popular pattern that can encompass a variety of features: load balancing, security policy management, service discovery, and routing. Tools which offer self-described “service mesh” functionality include Linkerd, Kong, AWS App Mesh, Solo.io Gloo, and Google’s Istio open source project.</p><p>Paul Banks is the engineering lead of Consul at HashiCorp.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>How do you build resilient, failure tested systems? Redundancy, backups, and testing are all important. But there is also an increasing trend towards chaos engineering–the technique of inducing controlled failures in order to prove that a system is fault tolerant in the way that you expect.</p><p>In last week’s episode with Kolton Andrus, we discussed one way to build chaos engineering as a routine part of testing a distributed system. Kolton discussed his company Gremlin, which injects failures by spinning up a Gremlin container and having that container induce network failures, memory errors, and filled up disks. In this episode, we explore another insertion point for testing controlled failures, this time from the point of view of Linkedin.</p><p>Linkedin is a social network for working professionals. As Linkedin has grown, the increased number of services has led to more interdependency between those services. The more dependencies a given service has, the more partial failure cases there are. That’s not to say there is anything wrong with having a lot of service dependencies–this is just the way we build modern applications. But it does suggest that we should try to test the failures that can emerge from so many dependencies.</p><p>Bhaskaran Devaraj and Xiao Li are engineers at Linkedin, and are working on a project called Waterbear, with the goal of making the infrastructure more resilient. </p><p>Linkedin’s backend system consists of a large distributed application with thousands of microservices communicating between each other. Most of those services communicate over Rest.li, a proxy for standardizing interactions between services. Rest.li can assist with routing, AB testing, circuit breaking, and other aspects of service-to-service communication. This proxy can also be used for executing controlled failures. As services are communicating with each other, creating a controlled failure can be as simple as telling your proxy not to send traffic to downstream services.</p><p>If that sounds confusing, don’t worry, we will explain it in more detail.</p><p>In this episode, Bhaskaran and Xiao describe their approach to resilience engineering at Linkedin–including the engineering projects and the cultural changes that are required to build a resilient software architecture.</p><p>Transcript provided by We Edit Podcasts.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>In the smartphone market there are two dominant operating systems: one closed source (iPhone) and one open source (Android). The market for self-driving cars could play out the same way, with a company like Tesla becoming the closed source iPhone of cars, and a company like Comma.ai developing the open source Android of self-driving cars.</p><p>George Hotz is the CEO of Comma.ai. Comma makes hardware devices that allow users with “normal” cars to be augmented with advanced cruise control and lane assist features. This means you can take your own car–for example, a Toyota Prius–and outfit your car to have something similar to the Tesla Autopilot. Comma’s hardware devices cost under $1000 to order online.</p><p>George joins the show to explain how the Comma hardware and software stack works in detail–from the low level interface with a car’s CAN bus to the high level machine learning infrastructure. </p><p>Users who purchase the Comma.ai hardware drive around with a camera facing the front of their windshield. This video is used to orient the state of the car in space. The video from that camera also gets saved and uploaded to Comma’s servers. Comma can use this video together with labeled events from the user’s driving experience to crowdsource their model for self-driving.</p><p>For example, if a user is driving down a long stretch of highway, and they turn on the Comma.ai driving assistance, the car will start driving itself and the video capture will begin. If the car begins to swerve into another lane, the user will take over for the car and the Comma system will disengage. This “disengagement” event gets labeled as such, and when that data makes it back to Comma’s servers, Comma can use the data to update their models.</p><p>George is very good at explaining complex engineering topics, and is also quite entertaining and open to discussing the technology as well as other competitors in the autonomous car space. I have not been able to get many other people on the show to talk about autonomous cars, so this was quite refreshing! I hope to do more in the future.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Cloud computing has pushed computation away from our own private servers and into virtual machines running on a data center. In the world of cloud computing, processing is centralized in these data centers, and our smartphone and laptop application performance suffers from having high latency between the client and the cloud server.</p><p>As machine learning proliferates, the current model of cloud computing will become too slow. A small difference in the time it takes to refresh a machine learning model for a drone or car could be the difference between life and death.</p><p>Computation will move to the edge. The same drones, cars, and IoT devices that need their models updated quickly will form a peer-to-peer network with which to distribute time-sensitive tasks. One bellwether for this real time peer-to-peer network might be <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2016/08/26/ubers-ringpop-with-jeff-wolski/">Uber’s Ringpop</a>, a fault-tolerant application layer sharding system.</p><p>In such an edge computing model, your device could federate a complex request out to other nearby devices that have spare processing capacity, pay for those compute cycles using Bitcoin, and receive a response without any request to a centralized cloud server. The cloud servers would still be around, but they would be responsible for doing offline computation across large data sets.</p><p>This prediction was described by Peter Levine, a partner at Andreessen Horowitz in his talk <a href="http://a16z.com/2016/12/16/the-end-of-cloud-computing/">“The End of Cloud Computing”</a>.

You have customers making a high volume of transactions, your service has to be low latency and highly available, and you are dealing with a lot of money. A cryptocurrency exchange has all of the complexity of a typical financial exchange–and then some additional complexity.</p><p>Shapeshift is a cryptocurrency exchange that allows users to buy and sell digital assets–Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and lots of other currencies. Shapeshift also has a set of tools and APIs that allow developers to build higher level applications that transact in cryptocurrencies. Shapeshift’s CEO is an early cryptocurrency entrepreneur named Erik Voorhees, who will appear on the show in the near future.</p><p>Today’s guest Jon is the COO of Shapeshift–he handles the operations of the company. He prefers not to use his last name, because Shapeshift is particularly sensitive to social engineering attacks. We’ll get into why that is in the episode–and explore lots of other topics too. How to scale a cryptocurrency exchange, the products Shapeshift offers, and some of the near-death experiences that Shapeshift has had. After all–it is a startup, and every startup has moments where it seems like the company will die.</p><p>Meetups for Software Engineering Daily are being planned!

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Despite all the problems with online advertising, ads are not going away. Advertising is fundamental to the modern Internet economy.</p><p>In previous episodes of Software Engineering Daily, we have mostly dissected the problems of adtech–bots, tracking, fraud, brand safety. We have talked about some solutions–for example, JavaScript tags that you can put on a page to identify a bot before you serve it an ad. But these solutions don’t get the job done completely, because it isn’t possible to reliably identify bots. Today we explore another solution for adtech: the whitelist.</p><p>Marc Goldberg is the CEO of Trust Metrics, a company that provides whitelisting for advertisers. A whitelist is a list of domains that are acceptable to run your advertisements on. In order to build a whitelist, you need to review thousands of sites to judge which ones are reasonable places to publish an advertisement. Marc joins the show to describe how to build and scale a system for reviewing websites and judging whether they are safe to run ads against.</p><p>The mobile apps are open sourced at <a href="http://github.com/softwareengineeringdaily">github.com/softwareengineeringdaily</a>. If you are looking for an open source project to hack on, we would love to get your help!

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Deepak Singh is the director of compute services at AWS, where he works on cloud products relating to containers, Linux, and High Performance Computing. In today’s show, Deepak describes how the market for containers and serverless has evolved, and how Amazon thinks about product strategy.</p><p>Back in 2014, Docker containers were becoming a popular way to deploy and manage application infrastructure. Containers allowed people to take advantage of their servers in a more economical way. Containers let developers move faster by quickly setting up and tearing down small composable units of software. </p><p>As these containers grew in number within software companies, companies started figuring out that they needed tooling to manage and orchestrate all these containers. Infrastructure software companies realized that there would be a big business in providing orchestration software to developers who needed to manage these high volumes of containers. This led to the “<a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/01/13/the-gravity-of-kubernetes/">container orchestration wars</a>”, in which a variety of companies such as Red Hat, CoreOS, Docker, and Mesosphere all began to offer platforms for managing containerized applications. </p><p>During the container orchestration wars, many large enterprises such as banks and telcos resisted picking any specific container orchestration system because there was no clear winner. Enterprises were hesitant to place a large bet on an infrastructure orchestration tool that might go out of fashion.</p><p>Amazon had a large number of customers that wanted to orchestrate their containers, but it was unclear how the market for open source container orchestration was going to unfold. Around this time, Amazon created ECS, a closed-source container orchestration system.</p><p>In the following years, Kubernetes was released and became the most popular container orchestrator. Amazon released EKS, a managed Kubernetes service. They also released AWS Lambda for running serverless functions and AWS Fargate for spinning up long-lived container instances.</p><p>Deepak and I discuss the history of containers at Amazon, but we also discuss how developer preferences are changing towards managed services, and how AWS is able to continually build off of its own tools to build higher and higher level services for developers.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Creating a podcast is still too difficult. One of the main barriers to entry is the editing process. After recording a podcast, the podcast producer needs to line up soundwaves in a digital audio workstation and clip the raw audio files to remove sections that need to be removed. As someone who has edited a lot of podcasts, I know that this is difficult and tedious.</p><p>One way of simplifying the editing process is to use speech-to-text to produce a transcription of an audio file, and aligning the text output with the audio. After that alignment, you have a mapping between the text and the audio–so you can delete text and have the corresponding audio be deleted as well.</p><p>SpeechBoard is a project by Craig Cannon and Ramon Recuero Moreno. SpeechBoard is an easy way to edit podcasts by deleting transcribed words that are mapped to an audio interview. In this episode, Craig, Ramon and I discuss how SpeechBoard is built and why this product hasn’t existed until recently. We also discuss the podcast world, which Craig is deeply familiar with as the host of Y-Combinator’s podcast. The YC podcast is one of my favorite shows, and if you like SE Daily, you will probably like the YC podcast, so check it out.</p><p>Transcript provided by We Edit Podcasts.

In many companies, new data has been produced rapidly for many years, but the company has not been able to take full advantage of it. </p><p>Creating large data sets does not provide immediate value for a company. A company needs to perform data engineering and data science to take full advantage of it.</p><p>When data gets generated, it is stored in a database, data lake, or API backend like Google Analytics. In order to manipulate that data, it is often pulled into a data warehouse. A data warehouse provides fast access time to large quantities of data.</p><p>Pulling data from a source like a database or data lake into a data warehouse requires a process known as extract and load. Once the data is in the data warehouse, it may also undergo a transform, which enriches the data or puts it in a format that is easier to make use of. Once data is in a data warehouse, it can be used to build models, interactive dashboards, and Jupyter Notebooks.</p><p>The data engineering lifecycle has many different components, which is why data engineering can often be intimidating to a company that is trying to make use of their data.

When two pictures have a conflict, that conflict needs to be resolved.</p><p>Mapillary is full of interesting engineering problems. The high volume of images and the level of processing has created the need for a unique sequence of indexing, queueing, and distributed processing using Apache Storm.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>At Coinbase, security is more important than anything else. Coinbase is a company that allows for storage and exchange of cryptocurrencies. Protecting banking infrastructure is difficult, but in some ways the stakes are higher with Coinbase, because bitcoin is fundamentally unregulated. </p><p>If a hacker were able to syphon all of the money out of Coinbase accounts, Coinbase would have no recourse–which means this is a more sensitive problem than the regulated banking system, where transactions can often be reversed.</p><p>Philip Martin is the director of security at Coinbase. He joins the show today to explain why his love of complex and high-stakes security challenges brought him to Coinbase. Philip has some specific points about Coinbase and some more abstract points about security that were very useful to me.</p><p>This is the third and final episode in our series about Coinbase. Our first two episodes covered the currencies of Coinbase and the fraud prevention techniques the company uses.

ReactVR is for building user interfaces in virtual reality.</p><p>React Native was originally developed to make it easier to maintain parity between the web, iOS, and Android teams at Facebook. If I build an application for the web with ReactJS, I can rewrite that application for React Native on iOS or Android and reuse some of my code from the web application. It is not a 1-click level of portability between platforms, but it helps share user interface components between different platforms.</p><p>ReactVR brings React development to virtual reality. Andrew Imm is a ReactVR developer at Facebook, and he joins the show to discuss how ReactVR works. We talk about the support for VR in the browser: WebGL, WebVR, and ThreeJS. We also explore some of the key React components that you might use to build an interface in ReactVR, and we wrap up the show by exploring VR more broadly–how consumers use VR today and how they might use it in the near future.</p><p>The iOS app is the first project to come out of the Software Engineering Daily Open Source Project.

In today’s episode, Dhruba Borthakur and Igor Canadi join for a deep dive into how RocksDB works. Dhruba was the original creator of RocksDB, and Igor is a former Facebook engineer who worked on RocksDB in its early days.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>GraphQL allows developers to communicate with all of their different data backends through a consistent query interface. A GraphQL query can be translated into queries to MySQL, MongoDB, ElasticSearch, or whatever kind of API or backend is needed to fulfill the GraphQL query. GraphQL users need to set up a GraphQL server to fulfill this query federation.</p><p>Prisma is a tool for automatically generating a GraphQL API and serving GraphQL queries. The developer defines a data model and deploys with Prisma. Prisma generates the necessary GraphQL infrastructure to serve queries from the developer’s database. This can allow the developer to get up and running faster than they would setting up GraphQL infrastructure and defining the middleware query layer by hand.</p><p>Prisma is an open source project, but it is also a company. The opportunities to build a business around a GraphQL infrastructure layer are numerous. </p><p>In recent episodes, we have explored the complexities of the “data platform.” From newer companies like <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/05/24/ubers-data-platform-with-zhenxiao-luo/">Uber</a> to <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/06/18/dremio-data-engineering-with-tomer-shiran/">older companies like Procter and Gamble</a>, engineers are struggling to find and access their data sources. <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/08/29/dataops-with-christopher-bergh/">Data engineers and data scientists spend months configuring their infrastructure to connect to BI tools and run distributed queries. </a></p><p>GraphQL could simplify data platforms by providing a unified, standardized layer.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Applications of artificial intelligence are permeating our everyday lives. We notice it in small ways–improvements to speech recognition; better quality products being recommended to us; cheaper goods and services that have dropped in price because of more intelligent production.</p><p>But what can we quantitatively say about the rate at which artificial intelligence is improving? How fast are models advancing? Do the different fields in artificial intelligence all advance together, or are they improving separately from each other? In other words, if the accuracy of a speech recognition model doubles, does that mean that the accuracy of image recognition will double also? </p><p>It’s hard to know the answer to these questions.</p><p>Machine learning models trained today can consume 300,000 times the amount of compute that could be consumed in 2012. This does not necessarily mean that models are 300,000 times better–these training algorithms could just be less efficient than yesterday’s models, and therefore are consuming more compute.</p><p>We can observe from empirical data that models tend to get better with more data. Models also tend to get better with more compute. How much better do they get? That varies from application to application, from speech recognition to language translation. But models do seem to improve with more compute and more data.</p><p>Dario Amodei works at OpenAI, where he leads the AI safety team. In a post called “AI and Compute,” Dario observed that the consumption of machine learning training runs is increasing exponentially–doubling every 3.5 months. In this episode, Dario discusses the implications of increased consumption of compute in the training process.</p><p>Dario’s focus is AI safety. AI safety encompasses both the prevention of accidents and the prevention of deliberate malicious AI application.</p><p>Today, humans are dying in autonomous car crashes–this is an accident. The reward functions of social networks are being exploited by botnets and fake, salacious news–this is malicious. The dangers of AI are already affecting our lives on the axes of accidents and malice. </p><p>There will be more accidents, and more malicious applications–the question is what to do about it. What general strategies can be devised to improve AI safety? After Dario and I talk about the increased consumption of compute by training algorithms, we explore the implications of this increase for safety researchers.</p><p>Transcript provided by We Edit Podcasts.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Red Hat was the first commercial open source software company. For years, investors and entrepreneurs assumed there would never be another Red Hat.</p><p>Red Hat’s business was built around enterprise operating system distribution and support. Since the operating system is at the core of how users within a company are doing their job, Red Hat had a lot of leverage and a strong business model. But how many enterprise software products could be so critical to a business that they could manage to offer their software as an open source option yet still make money?</p><p>As it turns out, there are many ways to make money in open source.</p><p>MySQL ate away at the dominance of Oracle’s database business for similar reasons to Red Hat’s success: much like an operating system, the database layer is critical infrastructure. Cloudera and Hortonworks were able to monetize the open source Hadoop project because Hadoop was hard to deploy and manage.</p><p>As cloud infrastructure matured, it became easier to start companies that offered open source software as-a-service. Elastic offers an easy way to use ElasticSearch. RedisLabs offers Redis as a service. MongoDB (the company) offers MongoDB as a service. As it turns out, engineers love to see the source code for databases, but they do not enjoy deploying and managing them and they are happy to pay providers to save them time.</p><p>Still, there is continued skepticism of open source businesses. </p><p>Today’s debates center around whether individual providers like Elastic can offer a service that competes with an ElasticSearch service offered by AWS. We could just as easily be asking the inverse question– how can AWS compete with an entire company that is dedicated to the deeply technical problem of solving search?</p><p>The reality is that most of these open source product categories have an enormous total addressable market, and extremely good unit economics. This applies to both cloud providers and point solution providers. Investors often talk about how much they love subscription businesses. When a company starts purchasing infrastructure-as-a-service from you, it is like they are buying a subscription where the annuity increases over time!</p><p>When an investor says they are worried about a giant cloud provider offering the same service as an open source company, it is similar to the investor being worried that a new sales tool is going to be duplicated by Salesforce. The market always needs new sales tools–and the market needs those tools to be offered both by Salesforce and by smaller CRM companies.</p><p>In the world of commercial open source, there is plenty of room for both point solution providers and cloud providers. But they are competing for the same customers, and the competitive battlefield is expanding to the nuanced world of software licensing. By changing their licenses, open source projects like Kafka, MongoDB, and Redis can prohibit AWS from certain usage patterns. This might offer some protection for companies based around the point solutions–companies like Confluent and RedisLabs.</p><p>Beyond the fracas of the battle between cloud providers and point solutions, there are newer open source companies with models that do not fit tightly into any historical business models. HashiCorp makes a suite of differentiated open source tools that have not been seriously contested or offered as a service by cloud providers. GitLab makes an open source platform that is built with monitoring, logging, CI, and code hosting out of the box.</p><p>As the world of open source business models expands, more companies will find opportunity in open sourcing the code that runs their products. In many cases, they will find that it strengthens their advantage rather than weakens it. The defensibility of many businesses relies more on data and network effects than the contents of the codebase. We may see the default question gradually shift from “why should I open source my codebase?” to “why shouldn’t I open source my codebase?”</p><p>Mike Volpi is a partner at Index Ventures and has invested in many open source businesses over the last decade. He is on the board of Confluent, Cockroach Labs, Kong, and Elastic. Mike joins the show to share his perspective on open source business models of the past, present, and future. </p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Ten years ago, there was a distinction between “backend” and “frontend” developers. A backend developer would be managing the business logic and database transactions using Ruby on Rails or Java. A frontend developer would be responsible for implementing designs and arranging buttons using raw HTML and JavaScript.</p><p>Today, developers can build entire applications in JavaScript. Developers who spent their early career developing frontend JavaScript skills are finding themselves with a surprising amount of power. With NodeJS providing a backend framework and React, Vue, or Angular on the frontend, a single JavaScript developer can write all the code for a whole application—hence the rise of the “full stack developer”.</p><p>At the same time, the cloud infrastructure is becoming easier to use. Backend-as-a-service simplifies the frustrations of deploying your application, and standing up a database. GraphQL improves the relationship between the frontend and the backend. And futuristic technologies like WebAssembly and web virtual reality are promising to make a JavaScript engineer’s life even more interesting.</p><p>Adam Conrad is an engineer and a writer for Software Engineering Daily. In recent articles, he has documented the changing nature of the frontend, including JavaScript engines, virtual reality, and how mature corporations are using React and GraphQL. He joins the show to share his perspective on what is changing in the frontend—and how full stack JavaScript engineers can position themselves for future success in a quickly changing market.</p>',

Most problematic, the company was bleeding cash due to a massive over-investment in cloud services.</p><p>This was the environment in which Yan Cui joined Yubl. The startup did have traction. There were social media stars who would announce on Twitter that they were about to go on Yubl, and Yubl would be hit by an avalanche of traffic. 50,000 users suddenly logging on to interact with their favorite celebrity was a significant traffic spike.</p><p>How do you deal with a traffic pattern like that? Serverless computing. AWS Lambda allowed the company to scale up quickly in a cost efficient manner. Yan began refactoring the entire backend infrastructure to be more cost efficient, heavily leveraging AWS Lambda.</p><p>Unfortunately, Yan’s valiant effort was not enough to save the company. But there are some incredible engineering lessons from this episode–how to build cost-effective, scalable infrastructure. It’s also a case study worth looking at if you work at a startup, whether or not you are an engineer.</p><p>Transcript provided by We Edit Podcasts.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Most people in Africa never had a desktop computer. The first computer they owned was a smart phone. This is why Africa is referred to as a “leap frog” place with regard to computers–Africa leapfrogged the desktop to the smart phone.</p><p>The banking system in Africa also followed a trajectory that is different than the West. Westerners are used to banking on their desktop computers. African e-commerce has developed around the smartphone as the computer for banking. As a result, Africa is in a technological development phase with tremendous opportunities in the financial sector and beyond. </p><p><a href="http://mymookh.com/">Mymookh.com</a> is a Kenyan end-to-end payment platform that allows small- to medium-sized businesses to easily set up online stores and sell to consumers directly from their social media pages. It is one of the many startups across Africa leveraging the accessibility of mobile payments to meet the particular needs of merchants and consumers there. Africa’s development and use of mobile payment systems is expected to grow as more countries on the continent create and adopt this technology.</p><p>In this episode, George Gachui, co-founder of Mymookh, talks to Carl Mungazi about how Kenya became a leading player in the mobile payment space with its m-pesa system. He explains how it has revolutionized the way Kenyans approach commerce and payment technology and discusses the challenges of creating a unified platform system that transcends borders and currencies. </p><p>Software Engineering Daily is having our third Meetup, Wednesday May 3rd at Galvanize in San Francisco. The theme of this Meetup is Fraud and Risk in Software. We will have great food, engaging speakers, and a friendly, intellectual atmosphere.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Imagine that you are a lawyer. </p><p>Your work involves managing files with dense, technical text. Your co-workers collaborate with you to accomplish a complex goal that can be broken down into smaller pieces. Your work has formal specifications, but there are degrees of freedom in how you express an idea. In all of these ways, the job of a lawyer is similar to the job of a software engineer–so why don’t lawyers use tools to improve their workflow?</p><p>As a software engineer, you have project management tools like Asana that improve collaboration. You have APIs like Stripe that reduce the time spent on a complicated implementation. You have tools like linters and source control that prevent you from making fatal errors. All of these tools save you time.</p><p>At many law firms, lawyers do not have incentive to save time. They are paid based on billable hours, not individual milestones. Historically, this hourly billing made sense–lawyers have been around since long before computers. The amount of work that might go into a legal task was hard to predict before you had computers to log data, sort documents, and standardize communications.</p><p>In contrast, a software engineer has always had the ability to automate work. That’s why (in most cases) we are not rewarded based on our time spent solving a task. We are paid based on hitting our KPIs and our milestones. With the legacy of hourly billing, lawyers can look at repetitive, administrative tasks as opportunities to make more money. </p><p>Justin Kan has been building startups for a decade, and in that time he has interacted with lots of lawyers. From incorporation to fundraising to selling his company Twitch, the interactions with lawyers consistently seemed less transparent and less efficient than would be optimal. </p><p>For an engineer like Justin, the natural inclination here was to build software and sell it to lawyers. But there would be so much resistance–you would have to convince the lawyers to change their pricing model to fixed-pricing, which would give them the incentive to buy software and work more efficiently.</p><p>Instead, Justin teamed up with a few entrepreneurial lawyers who were willing to start a new law firm from scratch, and use software on day 1. The software company is called Atrium Legal Technology Services (or Atrium LTS for short), and the law firm that uses the software is Atrium LLP. Both of these companies are very new, and were publicly announced a few months ago.</p><p>The two companies work side-by-side in undecorated office in downtown San Francisco. When I took the elevator up to see the company, the elevator doors opened and revealed two paper signs pointing to opposite ends of the office. On the Atrium LTS side of the office, engineers were writing software to extract the meaning from documents. </p><p>Today, lawyers at old law firms are paid hundreds of dollars an hour to fill in document templates by editing a text document. As the Atrium LTS software gets better, document preparation will be done through web applications, with the variable names disambiguated from the parts of the document that never change from client to client.</p><p>On the other side of the office sat Atrium LLP. The legal team was dressed a little more formally than their engineer counterparts, but there was nothing close to the formality of a traditional Silicon Valley law firm. Far from the decor of a Menlo Park law firm, the office space was actually more spartan than most well-funded startups, signaling to the employees that this is an unproven business strategy, and there is a ton of work to be done to validate it.</p><p>This sentiment was echoed in my conversation with Justin. It’s possible (even plausible) that Atrium LLP could become the biggest law firm in the world, but the road to getting there will take patience and steady execution. I enjoyed hearing Justin explain the motivation for starting Atrium LTS, and look forward to covering the company in the future.</p><p>We have done several other shows about the intersection of software engineering and law, including our show dissecting software antitrust with law professor Harry First.  To find our old episodes, you can download <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/software-engineering-daily-podcast-app/id1253734426?mt=8">the free Software Engineering Daily app for iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.koalatea.thehollidayinn.softwareengineeringdaily">for Android</a>.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>When Aran Khanna was a college student, he accepted an internship to work at Facebook. </p><p>Even before his internship started, he started playing around with Facebook’s APIs and applications. Aran built a Chrome extension called Marauder’s Map, which used Facebook Messenger’s web APIs to track where people lived, what their schedule was, and other highly sensitive information. These were not public features of Messenger, but Aran was able to reverse engineer the APIs.</p><p>As a result, of making Marauder’s Map, Aran’s invitation to work at Facebook was retracted. Aran remained curious about the norms of publicly available social network data, and the second order data sets that could be built on top. Out of this curiosity, Aran created a tool called Money Trail, which used public Venmo data to model a graph of how users were paying each other. Aran showed for a second time that data that seems innocent to share can be repurposed to identify, classify, and incriminate users.</p><p>Developers of these online applications face tradeoffs between privacy, convenience, and security. By interacting with these applications, we generate data that suggests how we think, what we like to do, and who we are affiliating with. Google and Facebook probably understand you better than you understand yourself.</p><p><a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/01/26/edge-deep-learning-with-aran-khanna/">Aran Khanna previously was on the show to talk about machine learning at the edge.</a> At the time he worked at Amazon Web Services.

Most of this food gets thrown away when it is still edible, and could provide nutrition to someone who is hungry. Just like Airbnb makes use of excess living capacity, OLIO was started to connect excess food with people who want to eat that food.</p><p>There are numerous challenges with this idea. How do you control quality and ensure the food is safe? How do you make money as a business? How do you solve the chicken and egg problem, and make sure that you get hungry users and people with food to give away at the same time?</p><p>Lloyd Watkin is a software engineer at OLIO, and he joins today’s episode to describe how the platform works, how it is built, and how the company plans to scale their large base of volunteers. It’s a fascinating set of operational and engineering issues.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Most applications today are either deployed to on-premise environments or deployed to a single cloud provider.</p><p>Developers who are deploying on-prem struggle to set up complicated open source tools like Kafka and Hadoop. Developers who are deploying to a cloud provider tend to stay within that specific cloud provider, because moving between different clouds and integrating services across clouds adds complexity.</p><p>Ben Hindman started the Apache Mesos project when he was working in the Berkeley AMPLab. Mesos is a scheduler for resources in a distributed system, allowing compute and storage to be scheduled onto jobs that can use those resources. In his time at the AMPLab, Ben collaborated with Matei Zaharia, creator of Apache Spark.</p><p>Ben founded Mesosphere based off of his work on Apache Mesos, and since 2013 he has been building a company to bring it to market. In the meantime, several market forces have influenced the enterprise market.</p><p>Enterprise businesses built on virtual machines and on-prem hardware are trying to migrate to containers, Kubernetes, and Spark. Cloud providers like Google and Microsoft have risen to prominence in addition to Amazon’s continued growth, and enterprises are increasingly willing to adopt multiple clouds.</p><p>I spoke with Ben Hindman at Kubecon North America. Today, the company that he co-founded works to provide tools for managing these changes in infrastructure. In our conversation, we talked about the necessary mindset shifts for taking a research project and turning it into a highly successful product. We also talked about the newer trends in infrastructure–why enterprises will want multicloud deployments and how serverless APIs and backends will make the lives of developers much easier.</p>',

A user interface component written in React Native can be used in both iOS and Android codebases. Since React Native allows for code reuse, this can save time for developers, in contrast to a model where completely separate teams have to create frontend logic for iOS and Android. </p><p>React Native was created at Facebook. Facebook itself uses React Native for mobile development, and contributes heavily to the open source React Native repository.</p><p>In 2016, Airbnb started using React Native in a significant portion of their mobile codebase.

Another use case is speculation: currency holders are owning currency in the hope that the market price of the currency will increase over time. </p><p>Bitcoin is a useful store of value and an instrument for speculation. However, Bitcoin still does not fulfill the financial use case that most people need from a currency: price stability. The price of Bitcoin fluctuates rapidly, making it difficult to use Bitcoin for small purchases such as coffee.</p><p>Imagine you want to buy a cup of coffee with Bitcoin. The coffee shop owner needs to offer the option to sell you that cup of coffee using Bitcoin as the medium of exchange. This owner must denominate the price of that coffee as some number of Bitcoin. Since the price of Bitcoin fluctuates so rapidly, the coffee shop owner needs to adjust the price of that cup of coffee constantly in order to make sure that the coffee is cheap enough for the consumer to want to buy it, but expensive enough to make a profit.</p><p>It is hard to assign prices to market goods in terms of Bitcoin because the currency is in constant flux. Even though many of us would like to use Bitcoin in our everyday lives, most marketplaces are denominated in US dollars or other currencies because a marketplace needs a stable currency in order to operate.</p><p>Rune Christensen is the CEO of MakerDAO, a system that provides a price-stable cryptocurrency. MakerDAO is an elegant set of currencies, collateralized debt, smart contracts, and other incentive tools that result in the creation of several transparent, decentralized financial instruments.</p><p>Rune joins the show to talk about the importance of stablecoins and how MakerDAO has engineered a decentralized currency that has maintained stability even through tumultuous market conditions.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Machines understand the world through mathematical representations. In order to train a machine learning model, we need to describe everything in terms of numbers.  Images, words, and sounds are too abstract for a computer. But a series of numbers is a representation that we can all agree on, whether we are a computer or a human.</p><p>In recent shows, we have explored how to train machine learning models to understand images and video. Today, we explore words. You might be thinking–”isn’t a word easy to understand? Can’t you just take the dictionary definition?” A dictionary definition does not capture the richness of a word. Dictionaries do not give you a way to measure similarity between one word and all other words in a given language.</p><p>Word2vec is a system for defining words in terms of the words that appear close to that word. For example, the sentence “Howard is sitting in a Starbucks cafe drinking a cup of coffee” gives an obvious indication that the words “cafe,” “cup,” and “coffee” are all related. With enough sentences like that, we can start to understand the entire language.</p><p>Adrian Colyer is a venture capitalist with Accel, and blogs about technical topics <a href="https://blog.acolyer.org/2016/04/21/the-amazing-power-of-word-vectors/">such as word2vec</a>. We talked about word2vec specifically, and the deep learning space more generally. We also explored how the rapidly improving tools around deep learning are changing the venture investment landscape.</p><p>If you like this episode, we have done many other shows about machine learning with guests like Matt Zeiler, the founder of Clarif.ai and Francois Chollet, the creator of Keras.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p><strong><em>We previously released this episode with the wrong audio file and are re-releasing it on a weekend.</em></strong></p><p>TIBCO was started in the 90’s with a popular message bus product that was widely used by finance companies, logistics providers, and other systems with high throughput. As TIBCO grew in popularity, the company expanded into other areas through products it developed in-house as well as through acquisitions.</p><p>One acquisition was Jaspersoft, a business intelligence data platform. When TIBCO acquired Jaspersoft in 2014, the architecture was a monolithic Java application. Around this time, customer use cases were shifting from centralized reporting to real-time, embedded visualizations. </p><p>The use case of the Jaspersoft software was becoming less centralized and less monolithic and the software architecture needed to change in order to reflect that.</p><p>Jan Schiffman is a VP of engineering at TIBCO and Sherman Wood is a director at TIBCO. They join the show to discuss the process of migrating a large Java monolith to a composable set of services. Breaking up a monolith is not an easy process–nor is it something that every company should do just because they have a monolith. In some cases, a monolith is just fine.</p><p>Jan and Sherman explain why the business use case for why the Jaspersoft monolith needed to be refactored, and their approach to the refactoring. We also talk through the modern use cases of embedded analytics and the interaction between business analysts and data engineers. At a higher level, we discuss the lessons they have learned from managing a large, complex refactoring. Full disclosure: TIBCO is a sponsor of Software Engineering Daily.</p>',

If a payment fails, engineers need to be able to diagnose what happened. The root cause could lie in any of those services.</p><p>Distributed tracing is used to find the causes of failures and latency within networked services. In a distributed trace, each period of time associated with a request is recorded as a span. The spans can be connected together because they share a trace ID.</p><p>The spans of a distributed trace are one element of observability. Others include metrics and logs. Each of these components of observability make their way into services like Lightstep and Datadog. The path traveled by different elements of observability is called the observability pipeline.</p><p>In an episode last year, Cory Watson explained how observability works at Stripe. In today’s episode, Cory describes how observability is created and aggregated. It’s a useful discussion for anyone working at a company that is figuring out how to instrument their systems for better monitoring.</p><p>Transcript provided by We Edit Podcasts.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>When a developer provisions a cloud server, that server is called an “instance”. These instances can be used for running whatever workload a developer has, whether it is a web application, a database, or a set of containers.</p><p>The cloud is cheap to get started on. New applications with few users can often be hosted on infrastructure that is less than $10 per month. But as an application grows in popularity, there is more demand for CPUs and storage. A company will start to buy more and more servers to scale up to the requirements of their growing user base. The costs of running infrastructure in the cloud will increase, and the company will start to look for ways to save money.</p><p>One common method of saving money is to buy “spot instances”. A spot instance is an instance that is cheaper than “reserved instances” or “on-demand” instances. The reason that there are different instance types is because a giant cloud provider has a highly variable amount of work that is being demanded from that cloud provider.</p><p>If you are in charge of AWS, you have to make sure that at any given time, you can give server resources to anyone that asks for it. Your data centers need to have physical machines that are ready to go at any time. This means that much of the time, you have server resources that are going unused.</p><p>If you are a cloud provider, how can you get people to use your compute resources? You can make them cheaper. So a user can come along and buy your compute at the discounted “spot” price.</p><p>But this presents a problem for the cloud provider. If you start to give away your compute at cheaper prices, and then the overall demand for your cloud resources go up once again, you are going to miss out on profits. As the cloud provider, you need to kick people off of your spot instances, so that you can take those same instances and sell them to people at the higher market prices.</p><p>And this presents a problem for the user. If you buy a cheap spot instance, that instance is only available until the cloud provider decides to kick you off. You have a tradeoff between cost and availability of your instances. Because of this, spot instances are typically used only for workloads that are not mission critical–workloads that can afford to fail.</p><p>Spotinst is a company that allows developers to deploy their workloads reliably onto spot instances. Spotinst works by detecting when a spot instance is going to be reclaimed by a cloud provider and re-scheduling the workload from that cloud provider onto a new spot instance.<br>\nAmiram Shachar is the CEO of Spotinst. He joins the show to talk about the different types of instances across cloud providers, the engineering behind Spotinst, and how the usage of containers and the rise of Kubernetes is changing the business landscape of the cloud. </p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Cloud computing changed the economics of running a software company. Before the cloud, a software company had to purchase physical machines which often required thousands of dollars paid up front. The cloud allowed developers to deploy their applications for free, to operate a business for cheap, and to scale without hiring a dedicated team to manage the servers.</p><p>Building in the cloud is cheap, but scaling in the cloud can get expensive. A growing company can often save money by changing which cloud instances and services they use. Reducing the number of server instances, changing the size of compute instances, and changing rules around auto scaling. By using monitoring, dashboards, and regular analysis of where money is spent, a business can find thousands of dollars of wasted spend per month.</p><p>There are also broad strategic decisions around cost. One area to study is the use of “managed” services like Amazon DynamoDB, Google BigQuery, and Amazon Lambda. These services are proprietary, and can lead to lock-in. Sometimes they can be quite expensive. But they can save developers hours of time because they are easy to use, and provide high uptime guarantees.</p><p>Ran Rothschild works at DoIT International, a company that helps businesses figure out how to save money on their cloud infrastructure. He joins the show to discuss the places where the most money is wasted and how startups can manage their infrastructure in a cost-effective manner. He also tells some stories about significant overspend. Full disclosure: DoIT International is a sponsor of Software Engineering Daily.</p>',

Contract work can be more flexible than full-time work, and often pays more than full-time software engineering, because contract jobs can end at any time, and they do not have the added employee benefits such as health insurance and stock options.</p><p>Online contracting platforms such as Upwork and Fiverr have expanded the number of software contracting engagements that take place. Developers on Upwork and Fiverr have a wide range of skills and experience levels. The clients who come on Upwork and Fiverr looking for developers are sometimes unsophisticated at managing software projects, and in some cases they defraud the software developers who are making their living online, and trick these software developers into delivering free work.</p><p><a href="http://moonlightwork.com">Moonlight</a> is a contracting platform for software engineers. Today’s guests Emma Lawson and Philip Thomas are the founders of Moonlight, and they join the show to explain why they started the company, and the gaps that exist in the world of software contracting. Moonlight’s model is different than most other contracting platforms, in that Moonlight requires clients to pay a $300 subscription fee to recruit engineers on the platform. This $300 subscription price lowers the rate at which clients take advantage of software engineers. This dynamic causes the software engineers to take their work more seriously and act more professionally.</p><p>Full disclosure: I am an investor in Moonlight.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Employees often find themselves needing to do work outside of the office. </p><p>Depending on the sensitivity of your task, accessing internal systems from a remote location may or may not be OK. If you are using a corporate application that shows the menu of your company’s cafe on your smartphone, your workload is less sensitive. If you are accessing the proprietary codebase of your company’s search engine, your workload is more sensitive.</p><p>As Google grew in headcount, the different cases of employees logging in from different places grew as well. Google developed a fine-grained, adaptive security model called BeyondCorp to allow for a wide variety of use cases. Whether you are an engineer logging in from a Starbucks or a human resources employee logging in from your desk, the BeyondCorp system uses the same access proxy to determine your permissions.</p><p>The BeyondCorp architecture is also built around the assumption of a zero-trust network. A zero-trust network is a modern enterprise security architecture where internal servers do not trust each other.</p><p>Zero-trust networks assume that the network has already been breached. If you are writing an internal application, your default assumption should be to distrust an incoming request from someone else on the network.</p><p>The zero-trust model is in contrast to an outdated model of enterprise security–that of the hard outer defense of a firewall, that purports to prevent attackers from ever making their way into the vulnerable inside of a network. The firewall model assumes that all of these servers within the firewall can trust each other.</p><p>Several papers have come out of Google discussing the BeyondCorp security model. These papers describe the network architecture, and the security philosophies of BeyondCorp. </p><p>Since the release of these papers, an ecosystem of security providers has sprung up to provide implementation services for companies that want BeyondCorp security in their enterprise. Google has also productized its BeyondCorp system with an identity-aware proxy that is tied into their Google Cloud product.</p><p>Max Saltonstall is the technical director of information technology in the office of the CTO at Google, where he has helped to facilitate the widespread adoption of the BeyondCorp program. In this episode, we talk about enterprise security–from remote employee access to zero-trust networks. We also talk about implementing the BeyondCorp model–why enterprises should consider it, and how to do it.</p><p>We have done lots of past shows about security–from car hacking to smart contract vulnerabilities to discussions with luminaries like Bruce Schneier and Peter Warren Singer.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>A popular software application serves billions of user requests. These requests could be for many different things. These requests need to be routed to the correct destination, load balanced across different instances of a service, and queued for processing. Processing a request might require generating a detailed response to the user, or making a write to a database, or the creation of a new file on a file system.</p><p>As a software product grows in popularity, it will need to scale these different parts of infrastructure at different rates. You many not need to grow your database cluster at the same pace that you grow the number of load balancers at the front of your infrastructure. Your users might start making 70% of their requests to one specific part of your application, and you might need to scale up the services that power that portion of the infrastructure.</p><p>Today’s episode is a case study of a high-volume application: a monitoring platform called Raygun. </p><p>Raygun’s software runs on client applications and delivers monitoring data and crash reports back to Raygun’s servers. If I have a podcast player application on my iPhone that runs the Raygun software, and that application crashes, Raygun takes a snapshot of the system state and reports that information along with the exception, so that the developer of that podcast player application can see the full picture of what was going on in the user’s device, along with the exception that triggered the application crash.</p><p>Throughout the day, applications all around the world are crashing and sending requests to Rayguns servers. Even when crashes are not occurring, Raygun is receiving monitoring and health data from those applications. Raygun’s infrastructure routes those different types of requests to different services, queues them up, and writes the data to multiple storage layers–ElasticSearch, a relational SQL database, and a custom file server built on top of S3.</p><p>John-Daniel Trask is the CEO of Raygun and he joins the show to describe the end-to-end architecture of Raygun’s request processing and storage system. We also explore specific refactoring changes that were made to save costs at the worker layer of the architecture. This is useful memory management strategy for anyone working in a garbage collected language. If you would like to see diagrams that explain the architecture and other technical decisions, the show notes have <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/dotnetConf/2015/Handling-billions-of-exceptions-with-NET--Raygunio">a video that explains what we talk about in this show</a>.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>At a big enough scale, every software product produces lots of data. Whether you are building an advertising technology company, a social network, or a system for IoT devices, you have thousands of events coming in at a fast pace that you want to aggregate, study and act upon. </p><p>For the last decade, engineers have been learning to store and process these vast quantities of data. </p><p>The first common technique was to store all your data to HDFS–the Hadoop Distributed File System–and run nightly Hadoop MapReduce jobs across that data. HDFS is cheap (stored on disk), effective (Hadoop had a revolutionary effect on business analysis), and easy to understand (“every night we take all the data from the previous day, analyze it with Hadoop, and send an email report to our analysts”).</p><p>The second common technique was the “Lambda Architecture.” The Lambda Architecture used a stream processing system like Apache Storm to process all incoming events as soon as they were created, so that software products could react quickly to the changes occurring in a large scale system. But events would sometimes be processed out of order, or they would get lost due to node failures. To fix those errors, the nightly Hadoop MapReduce jobs would still run, and would reconcile all the problems that might have occurred when the events were processed in the streaming system.</p><p>The Lambda Architecture worked pretty well–systems were becoming “real time”, and products like Twitter were starting to feel alive as they were able to rapidly process the massive volume of events on the fly. But managing a system with a Lambda Architecture was painful–you had to manage both a Hadoop cluster and a Storm cluster. You had to make sure that your Hadoop processing did not interfere with your Storm processing.</p><p>Today, a newer technique for ingesting and reacting to data has become more common, and is referred to as “streaming analytics.” Streaming analytics is a strategy for performing fast analysis of data coming into a system.</p><p>In streaming analytics systems, events are sent to a scalable, durable pubsub system such as Kafka. You can think of Kafka as a huge array of events that have occurred–such as users liking tweets or clicking on ads. Stream processing systems like Apache Flink or Apache Spark read the data from Kafka as if they were reading an array that was being continually appended to.</p><p>The sequence of events that get written to Kafka are called “streams”. This can be confusing–with a stream, you imagine this constantly moving, transient sequence of data. That’s partially true, but data will stay in Kafka as long as you want it to. You can set a retention policy for 2 weeks, 2 months, or 2 years. As long as that data is still retained in Kafka, your stream processing system can start reading from any place in the stream.</p><p>The stream processing systems like Flink or Spark that read from Kafka are still grabbing batches of data, and processing them in batches. They are reading from the event stream buffer in Kafka, which you can think of as an array. (This is something that confused me for a long time, so if you are still confused, don’t worry, we explain it more in this episode.)</p><p>Tugdual Grall is an engineer with MapR. In today’s episode, we explore use cases and architectural patterns for streaming analytics. Full disclosure: MapR is a sponsor of Software Engineering Daily.</p><p>In past shows, we have covered data engineering in detail–we’ve looked at Uber’s streaming architecture, talked to Matei Zaharia about the basics of Apache Spark, and explored the history of Hadoop.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Relational databases have been popular since the 1970s, but in the last 20 years the amount of data that applications need to collect and store has skyrocketed. The raw cost to store that data has decreased. There is a common phrase in software companies: “it costs you less to save the data than to throw it away.”</p><p>Saving the data is cheap, but accessing that data in a useful way can be expensive. Developers still need rapid row-wise and column-wise access to the data. Accessing an individual row of a database can be useful if a user is logging in and you want to load all of that user’s data, or if you want to update a banking system with a new financial transaction. Accessing an entire column of a database can be useful if you want to aggregate summaries of all of the entries in a system–like the sum of all financial transactions in a bank.</p><p>These different kinds of transactions are nothing new, but with the growing scale of data, companies are changing their mentality from thinking in terms of individual databases to thinking about distributed “data platforms.”</p><p>In a data platform, the data across a company might be put into a variety of storage systems–distributed file systems, databases, in-memory caches, search indexes–but the API for the developer is kept simple. And the simplest, most commonly understood language is SQL.</p><p>Marco Slot is an engineer with Citus Data, a company that makes Postgres scalable. Postgres is one of the most common relational databases, and in this episode Marco describes how Postgres can be used to service almost all of the needs of a data platform.</p><p>This isn’t easy to do, as it requires sharding your growing relational database into clusters and orchestrating distributed queries between those shards. In this show, Marco and I discuss Citus’s approach to the distributed systems problems of a sharded relational database. This episode is a nice complement to previous episodes we have done with Ozgun and Craig from Citus, in which they gave a history of relational databases, and explained how Postgres compares to the wide variety of relational databases out there.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Tinder is a rapidly growing social network for meeting people and dating. In the past few years, Tinder’s userbase has grown rapidly, and the engineering team has scaled to meet the demands of increased popularity.</p><p>On Tinder, you are presented with a queue of suggested people that you might match with, and you swipe left or right to indicate that you like or dislike them. Creating that queue of suggestions is a complex engineering problem. Many factors go into the suggestions that Tinder gives you: geotargeting, food preferences, your favorite band, your photos, and the people you have swiped on in the past.</p><p>Bryan Li is an engineering manager at Tinder, and he joins the show to describe the interaction between the mobile client, backend servers, and the offline analytics and machine learning. We also talk about managing different teams and how to reorganize smoothly as a company grows.</p><p>The mobile apps are open sourced at <a href="http://github.com/softwareengineeringdaily">github.com/softwareengineeringdaily</a>.

These events can be users clicking, IoT sensors accumulating data, or log messages.</p><p>The cost of cloud storage and compute continues to drop, so engineers can afford to build applications around these high volumes of events, and a variety of tools have been developed to process them. Apache Kafka is widely used to store and queue these streams of data, and Apache Spark and Apache Flink are stream processing systems that are used to perform general purpose computations across this event stream data.</p><p>Kafka, Spark, and Flink are great general purpose tools, but there is also room for a more narrow set of distributed systems tools to support high volume event data. Apache Druid is an open source database built for high performance, read only analytic workloads. Druid has a useful combination of features for event data workloads, including a column-oriented storage system, automatic search indexing, and a horizontally scalable architecture.</p><p>Druid’s feature set allows for new types of analytics applications to be built on top of it, including search applications, dashboards, and ad-hoc analytics. Fangjin Yang is a core contributor to Druid and the CEO of Imply.io, a company that makes a storage, querying, and visualization tool build on top of Druid. He joins the show to talk about the architecture of Druid and his company Imply.</p>',

We’ve learned how to scale Internet applications like e-commerce stores and online games. It’s easy to forget, but there was a time when those systems didn’t perform well either.</p><p>Scaling a blockchain is different than scaling a relational database or a microservices infrastructure. Blockchains are peer-to-peer databases with an append only ledger shared by thousands of nodes. With different scalability solutions, there are tradeoffs between decentralization, scalability, and security. As an example, in Bitcoin, the core developers are working towards deployment and adoption of lightning network. Some would argue that this approach favors scalability over decentralization.</p><p>Today’s show is about scaling Ethereum.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Developers can build networked applications today without having to deploy their code to a server. These “serverless” applications are constructed from managed services and functions-as-a-service.</p><p>Managed services are cloud offerings like database-as-a-service, queueing-as-a-service, or search-as-a-service. These managed services are easy to use. They take care of operational burdens like scalability and outages. But managed services typically solve a narrow use case. You can’t build an application entirely out of managed services.</p><p>Managed services are scalable and narrow. Functions-as-a-service are scalable and flexible.</p><p>With managed services, you make remote calls to a service with a well-defined API. With functions-as-a-service, you can deploy your own code. But functions-as-a-service execute against transient, unreliable compute resources. They aren’t a good fit for low latency computation, and the code you run on them should be stateless.</p><p>Managed services and functions-as-a-service are the perfect complements. </p><p>Managed services provide you with well-defined server abstractions that every application needs—like databases, search indexes, and queues. Functions as a service offer flexible “glue code” that you can use to create custom interactions between the managed services.</p><p>The term “serverless” is used to describe the applications that are built entirely with managed services and functions as a service.</p><p>Serverless applications are dramatically simpler to build and easier to operate than cloud applications of the past. The costs of managed services can get expensive, but the costs of functions as a service can cost 1/10th of what it might take to run a server that is handling your requests.</p><p>Whether the size of your bill will increase or decrease as your company becomes “serverless” is less of an issue than the fact that your employees will be more productive: serverless applications have less operational burden, so developers spend more time architecting and implementing software. </p><p>It has been 5 years since <a href="http://perfcap.blogspot.com/2012/03/ops-devops-and-noops-at-netflix.html">the Netflix infrastructure team was talking about the aspirational goal of a “no-ops” software culture</a>. Your software should be so well-defined that you do not need regular intervention of ops staff to reboot your servers and reconfigure your load balancers. Serverless is a newer way of moving operational expense into capital expense.</p><p>Today’s guest Randall Hunt is a senior technical evangelist with Amazon Web Services. He travels around the world meeting developers and speaking at conferences about AWS Lambda, the functions as a service platform from Amazon. Randall has given some excellent talks about how to architect and build serverless applications (which I will add to the show notes), and today we explore those application patterns further.</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/Qbsk7GLPYwk">Serverless Services – Randall Hunt</a></p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/DBqy-m0VM9U">Randall Hunt at AWS Summit Seoul</a></p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/F8-y_d7l-2c">Serverless, What is it Good For?

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Log messages are fast, high volume, unstructured data. Logs are often the source of metrics, alerts, and dashboards, so these critical systems are downstream from a log management system. A log management system needs to be highly available, so that a failure in one part of your system will not be correlated with failure of the log management system.</p><p>Users of a log management system are often building tools based off of the query engine of that log management system. For example, I might build a dashboard that gives me a line graph representing the number of times a certain log message is alerting me due to a memory warning. I write a query to return the instances of these memory warnings, and my line graph is a visual representation that query. A log management system needs to be able to quickly serve users that are querying their logs–whether for dashboards or for ad-hoc queries.</p><p>When logs are ingested by a log management system, the logs get parsed in a way that can bring some structure to the blob of text that is a raw log message. Some log management systems will then add the log message to an index. An index can allow for very fast lookups of particular types of queries. But an index also has certain constraints–such as processing regular expression queries.</p><p>Steve Newman is the CEO and founder of Scalyr, a log management system that uses a column-oriented data storage system instead of the more conventional index-based log management systems. Today’s episode is a great case study in distributed systems tradeoffs. Steve talks in great detail about how Scalyr maintains high uptime, and its system for ingesting logs and serving queries.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>“Edge computing” is a term used to define computation that takes place in an environment outside of a data center. Edge computing is a broad term. Your smartphone is an edge device. A self-driving car is an edge device. A security camera with a computer chip is an edge device. </p><p>These “edge devices” have existed for a long time now, but the term “edge computing” has only started being used more recently. Why is that? It is mostly because the volume of data produced by edge devices, and the type of computation that we want from edge devices is changing. </p><p>We want to develop large sensor networks to enable smart factories, and smart agriculture fields. We want our smartphones to have machine learning models that get updated as frequently as possible. We want to use self-driving cars, and drones, and smart refrigerators to develop elaborate mesh networks–and perhaps even have micropayments between machines, so that computation can be offloaded from edge devices to a nearby mesh network for a small price.</p><p>Kubernetes is a tool for orchestrating distributed, containerized computation. Just as Kubernetes is being widely used for data center infrastructure, it can also be used to orchestrate computation among nodes on-premise at a factory, or in a smart agriculture environment. In today’s episode, Venkat Yalla from Microsoft joins the show to talk about Kubernetes at the edge, and how Internet of things applications can use Kubernetes for their deployments today–and what the future might hold.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Humans organize into groups. There are lots of group types: religions, corporations, national governments, state governments, citizenries, clubs, musical bands.</p><p>Every group has governance. Governance defines the rules, and the ways that rules change. The United States requires citizens to pay taxes. A corporation requires you to show up to work, but they have to pay you a salary.</p><p>Most groups today are managed by people. If you break a law, you have to go to court and sit in front of a judge and jury, who decide how you will be punished. If you work at a corporation, and you have a problem with your manager, you go to HR to arbitrate it.</p><p>These organizations are centralized. There is a governing body who sets the rules. If there is an ambiguity, the person who happens to be in power gets to decide how the ambiguity is resolved. Power is centralized in that governing body.</p><p>These organizations are run by people. The governance of these organizations is enforced only to the extent that the human government carries out its duties.</p><p>A decentralized autonomous organization is a group that can run with neither centralized nor human intervention. It is decentralized and autonomous. It is a DAO.</p><p>Aragon is a platform for running and managing decentralized autonomous organizations. Luis Cuende is the founder of Aragon, and joins the show to explain what a DAO is and why people want to create them. We also talk about the engineering of Aragon and the structure of its ICO—which raised $25m via token sale.</p><p>Meetups for Software Engineering Daily are being planned!

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>When a user takes a ride on Uber, the app on the user’s phone is communicating with Uber’s backend infrastructure, which is writing to a database that maintains the state of that user’s activity. This database is known as a transactional database or “OLTP” (online transaction processing). Every active user and driver and UberEATS restaurant is writing data to the transactional data store.</p><p>Periodically, that data is copied from the transactional data system to a different data storage system, where that data can be queried for large-scale data analysis. For example, if a data scientist at Uber wants to get the average amount of miles that a given user rode in February, that data scientist would issue a query to the analytical data cluster.</p><p>Uber uses the Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS) to store analytical data. On this file system, Uber has a version history of all of the company’s useful historical data. Trip history, rider activity, driver activity–every data point that is in the transactional database–but in a file format that is easier to query for large scale processing. This file format is known as Parquet.</p><p>Data scientists, machine learning engineers, and real-time application developers all depend on the massive quantities of data that are stored in these Parquet files on Uber’s HDFS cluster. To simplify the access of that data by many different clients, Uber uses Presto, an analytical query engine originally built at Facebook. </p><p>Presto translates SQL queries into whatever query language is necessary to access the underlying storage medium–whether that storage system is an ElasticSearch cluster, a set of Parquet files, or a relational database. Presto is useful because it simplifies the relationship between data engineers and the application developers who are building on top of the data engineering infrastructure.</p><p>In today’s show, Zhenxiao Luo joins to give an end-to-end description of Uber’s data infrastructure–from the ingest point of the OLTP database to the OLAP data storage system on HDFS, to the wide range of data systems and applications that run on top of that OLAP data.</p><p>Transcript provided by We Edit Podcasts.

In his years at Facebook, he worked on infrastructure, internal tools, and management. He became deeply familiar with the company culture and its operations. Pedram joins the show to talk about how Facebook has scaled and the lessons he took away from his time there.</p><p>After his time at Facebook, Pedram joined Uber, where he worked as a director of engineering for four years. Uber is another multi-user application, with a very different set of constraints. At Uber, Pedram worked on several projects, including Uber’s push into China, which he describes as an intense, competitive experience. Pedram is able to contrast the culture and scaling processes of Uber, Facebook, and Google which made this a rare opportunity to see how three different high performing companies build software differently.</p>',

Howard is the CEO of StartEngine, a company that functions as an accelerator, a crowdfunding platform, and ICO launcher.</p><p>Howard joins the show to talk about his background as an entrepreneur, as well as some modern alternative funding mechanisms that he’s working on at StartEngine. Hearing Howard’s thoughts on building a video game company in the 90’s was particularly new information to me–it’s an era of software development that we have not covered much at all.</p><p>As a side note–some listeners have asked recently why we cover subjects such as ICOs, when there have been so many dubious companies that have launched ICOs. </p><p>There are two reasons why we cover this area. Firstly, cryptocurrencies are a breakthrough computer science construct. It’s important for us to try to understand their implications. The other reason why we cover ICOs is that some technology companies require high upfront capital costs. The amount of capital you have available affects the speed at which your engineering team can move. New funding mechanisms could mean more capital for certain types of software companies–and this could be a good thing and a bad thing, depending on the company.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Insurance is an old business. Individuals and businesses have been buying insurance policies for decades. These insurance policies can cost hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands of dollars per year.  </p><p>Software is remaking the insurance industry.</p><p>One way new software can improve the insurance industry is through better brokerage technology. Insurance involves carriers and brokers, who work together on delivering insurance solutions to customers. The initiation and closing of an insurance transaction often involves lots of emails, PDF files, and antiquated software systems. Technology improvements will smooth out this process and reduce manual overhead.</p><p>Another way insurance can improve thanks to technology is through smarter pricing. The price of an insurance policy is offered to a customer based on how risky the insurance policy is, how large the customer pool is, and how much the insurance company could lose in the event that it would have to pay out an insurance policy. These risk profiles are calculated based on historical data.</p><p>Gordon Wintrob is the co-founder and CTO of Newfront Insurance. Gordon joins the show to discuss the insurance industry and how his company got started.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Napster, Kazaa, and Bittorrent are peer-to-peer file sharing systems. In these P2P systems, nodes need to find each other. Users need to be able to search for files that exist across the system. P2P systems are decentralized, so these routing problems must be solved without a centralized service in the middle.</p><p>Without a centralized service that has all the information in one place, how can you solve these problems of node discovery and file lookup? This is the central question that Petar Maymounkov sought to answer with Kademlia.</p><p>Kademlia is a peer-to-peer distributed hash table. Kademlia implements the “put” and “get” operations of an efficiently scalable hash table without using any centralized service. Each node in the system maintains its own routing table. When a user queries the system (a “get” operation), that query is serviced by the nodes coordinating with each other to intelligently route the user to their target location. When a file is stored (a “put” operation), that update to the file system can propagate through the network in a decentralized, uncoordinated way.</p><p>Petar joins the show to give a brief history of P2P networks, why he created Kademlia, and what he is working on today.</p><p>Transcript provided by We Edit Podcasts.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>An instruction set defines a low level programming language for moving information throughout a computer. In the early 1970’s, the prevalent instruction set language used a large vocabulary of different instructions. One justification for a large instruction set was that it would give a programmer more freedom to express the logic of their programs.</p><p>Many of these instructions were rarely used. Think of your favorite programming language (or your favorite human language). What percentage of words in the vocabulary do you need to communicate effectively? We sometimes call these language features “syntactic sugar”. They add expressivity to a language, but may not improve functionality or efficiency.</p><p>These extra language features can have a cost.</p><p>Dave Patterson and John Hennessy created the RISC architecture: Reduced Instruction Set Compiler architecture. RISC proposed reducing the size of the instruction set so that the important instructions could be optimized for. Programs would become more efficient, easier to analyze, and easier to debug.</p><p>Dave Patterson’s first paper on RISC was rejected. He continued to research the architecture and advocate for it. Eventually RISC became widely accepted, and Dave won a Turing Award together with John Hennessy.</p><p>Dave joins the show to talk about his work on RISC and his continued work in computer science research to the present. He is involved in the Berkeley RISELab and works at Google on the Tensor Processing Unit. </p><p>Machine learning is an ocean of new scientific breakthroughs and applications that will change our lives. It was inspiring to hear Dave talk about the changing nature of computing, from cloud computing to security to hardware design.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>The easiest way to train a computer to recognize a picture of cat is to show the computer a million labeled images of cats. The easiest way to train a computer to recognize a stop sign is to show the computer a million labeled stop signs. </p><p>Supervised machine learning systems require labeled data. Today, most of that labeling needs to be done by humans. When a large tech company decides to “build a machine learning model,” that often requires a massive amount of effort to get labeled data. </p><p>Hundreds of thousands of knowledge workers around the world earn their income from labeling tasks. An example task might be “label all of the pedestrians in this intersection.” You receive a picture of a crowded intersection, and your task is to circle all the pedestrians. You have now created a piece of labeled data.</p><p>Scale API is a company that turns API requests into human tasks. Their most recent release is an API for labeling data that has been generated from sensors. As self-driving cars emerge onto our streets, the sensors on these cars generate LIDAR, radar, and camera data. The cars will interpret that data in real time using their machine learning models, and then they will send that data to the cloud so that the data can be processed offline to improve the machine learning models of every car on the road.</p><p>The first step in that processing pipeline is the labeling–which is the focus of today’s conversation. Alexandr Wang is the CEO of Scale, and he joins the show to discuss self-driving cars, labeling, and the company he co-founded.</p><p>A few notes before we get started.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Robinhood is a platform for buying and selling stocks, cryptocurrencies, and other assets. Since its founding in 2013, Robinhood has grown to have more than 3 million user accounts, which is approximately the same as the popular online broker E-Trade. With the surge in user growth and transaction volume, the demands on the software infrastructure have increased significantly.</p><p>When a user buys a stock on Robinhood, that transaction gets written to Kafka and Postgres. Multiple services get notified of the new entry on the Kafka topic, and those services process that new event using Kafka Streams. Kafka Streams are a way of reading streams of data out of Kafka with exactly-once semantics. Developers at Robinhood use a variety of languages to build services on top of these Kafka streams–including Python. </p><p>Commonly used systems for building stream processing tasks on top of a Kafka topic include Apache Flink and Apache Spark. Spark and Flink let you work with large data sets while maintaining high speed and fault-tolerance. These tools are written in Java. If you want to write a Python program that interfaces with Apache Spark, you have to pay an expensive serialization/deserialization cost as you move that object between Python and Spark.</p><p>Ask Solem is an engineer with Robinhood, and the author of Faust, a stream processing library that ports the ideas of Kafka Streams to Python. Faust provides stream processing and event processing in a manner that is similar to Kafka Streams, Apache Spark, and Apache Flink. He is also the author of the popular Celery asynchronous task queue. Ask joins the show to provide his perspective on large scale, distributed stream processing, and why he created Faust.</p>',

Some people are happy investing their money in a roboadviser, which programmatically puts money into long-term investments. Other people want a more personal approach involving a certified financial planner (CFP). A CFP is a human who allocates capital for an individual based off of that individual’s preferences.</p><p>A CFP spends time and effort researching the options for a client. If the client only has a small amount of money (say, $15,000), it is not worth it for the CFP to spend much time on that account. As a result, there is a type of client who has saved a little bit of money, but has not saved enough to be an important client for a CFP.</p><p>Facet Wealth is a software company that makes software for CFPs to work more effectively with their client accounts. Facet Wealth has in-house CFPs who work with this software to manage client accounts.

The complexity of queries increases, requiring more sophisticated logic in order to maintain performance. New databases need to be added to the overall system, as users begin to have demands for advanced features such as search, or analytics.</p><p>Over time, the requirements for a database expand into a need for a data platform.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Java programs compile into Java bytecode. Java bytecode executes in the Java Virtual Machine, a runtime environment that compiles that bytecode further into machine code, and optimizes the runtime by identifying “hot” code paths and keeping those hot code paths executing quickly. </p><p>The Java Virtual Machine is a popular platform for building languages on top of. Languages like Scala and Clojure compile down to Java bytecode, and can take advantage of the garbage collection system and the code path optimizations of the JVM. But when Scala and Clojure compile into Java bytecode, the code “shape”–the way that the programs are laid out in memory–is not the same as when Java programs compile into Java bytecode. Executing bytecode that comes from Scala will have certain performance penalties relative to a functionally identical program written in Java.</p><p>GraalVM is a system for interpreting languages into Java bytecode that can run efficiently on the JVM. Any language can be interpreted into an abstract syntax tree that the GraalVM can execute using the JVM. Languages that can run on GraalVM include JavaScript, R, Ruby, and Python.</p><p>Thomas Wuerthinger is a senior research director at Oracle and the project lead for GraalVM. He joins the show to explain the motivation for GraalVM, the architecture of the project, and the future of language interoperability.

We have a few more shows on the topic before we move on to covering other aspects of software. If you have feedback on this thematic format (whether you like it or not), send me an email: jeff@softwareengineeringdaily.com</p><p>Today’s episode fits nicely into some of the themes we have covered recently–Cloud Foundry, Kubernetes, and the changing landscape of managed services. Sean McKenna works on all three of these things at Microsoft.</p><p>We spent much of our time discussing the use cases of container instances versus Kubernetes. Container instances are individual managed containers–so you could spin up an application within a container instance without having to deal with the Kubernetes control plane. Container instances might be described as “serverless containers,” since you do not have to program against the underlying VM at all.</p><p>This begs the question–why would you want to use a managed Kubernetes service if you could just use individual managed containers? Sean explores this question, and gives his thoughts on where this ecosystem is headed.

The potential use cases for Mapillary are numerous, ranging from self-driving cars to augmented reality.</p><p>We can now build a 3-D model of the real world. It’s not a perfect representation of reality, but it is much better than we had just a few years ago. What has changed? How have the tools advanced such that we are able to build an API for accessing accurate information about the physical world around us? </p><p>Mapillary is possible because of a combination of modern developments.</p><p>High quality smartphone cameras enable users to crowdsource images of the world around them. Cloud computing allows for cheap workload processing. Newer computer vision techniques allow 2-D images to be stitched together in a 3-D representation. Deep learning architectures improve the classification and segmentation of objects in an image.</p><p>Peter Kontschieder is the head of research at Mapillary, and he joins the show to talk about the technologies and research that has enabled Mapillary to build a futuristic business–an API for accessing information about the physical world.</p><p><em>Software Engineering Daily is looking for sponsors.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Google’s central system for managing compute resources is called Borg. On Borg, millions of Linux containers process a wide variety of workloads. When a new application is spun up, Borg provides that application with the resources it needs.</p><p>Workloads at Google usually fall into one of two distinct categories: long-running application workloads (such as Gmail) and batch workloads (such as a MapReduce job). In the early days of Google, the long-lived workloads were scheduled onto a system called “BabySitter” and the batch workloads were scheduled onto a system called “Global Work Queue.”</p><p>Borg was the first cluster manager at Google designed to service both long-running and batch workloads from a single system. The second cluster manager at Google was Omega, a project that was created to improve the engineering behind Borg. The innovations of Omega improved efficiency and architecture of Borg. </p><p>More recently, Kubernetes was created as an open source implementation of the ideas pioneered in Borg and Omega. Google has also built a Kubernetes as a service offering that companies use to run their infrastructure in the same way that Google does.</p><p>Brian Grant is an engineer at Google who has seen the iteration of all three cluster management systems that have come out of Google. He joins the show to discuss how the workloads at Google have changed over time, and how his perspective on how to build and architect distributed systems has evolved.

There is a great deal of creative work that goes into making a game successful, and these games are often built with low budgets by people who are driven by the art and passion of game creation.</p><p>A game engine is a system used to build and run games. Game engines let the programmer work at a high level of abstraction, by providing interfaces for graphics, physics, and scripting. Popular game engines include Unreal Engine and Unity, both of which require a license that reduces the amount of money received by the game developer.</p><p>Godot is an open source and free to use game engine. The project was started by Juan Linietsky, who joins the show to discuss his motivation for making Godot. We have done some great shows on gaming in the past, <a href="https://www.softwaredaily.com/search?query=gaming">which you can find on SoftwareDaily.com</a>.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Kubernetes has created a widespread system for deploying and managing infrastructure. As Kubernetes has been increasingly adopted, companies are thinking about how to leverage that common layer of infrastructure. With the common infrastructure abstraction of Kubernetes, it becomes easier to adopt other abstractions that are uniform across the entire company. </p><p>This has created a market opportunity for products such as a service mesh.</p><p>A service mesh consists of sidecar containers that get deployed alongside services in a distributed system. Each sidecar container is used as a proxy for all the communication that goes through the service it is deployed with. This consistent proxying layer provides each service with benefits such as security, routing, telemetry, and policy management.</p><p>Istio is a service mesh that was created and open sourced by Google. Istio is built around the Envoy service proxy sidecar and a control plane that manages the Envoy sidecars. Since the launch of Istio, some of the Google employees who were working on Istio have started Tetrate, a company with the goal of commercializing Istio into a product that enterprises will pay for.  </p><p>The market demand for service mesh has been proven, but there are many competitors to Tetrate. Istio is open source and can be commercialized by other companies, as well as cloud providers such as Google and AWS. Linkerd is a service mesh built by the company Buoyant, which was the first company to focus exclusively on this space. There are other companies that are expanding existing products into service mesh: Kong, NGINX, and Hashicorp.</p><p>Zack Butcher is a founding engineer with Tetrate, and he joins the show to discuss the market for service mesh and the plan for Tetrate to build a business around Istio.</p>',

LinkedIn’s engineering team was building a range of externally facing products and internal tools, and many of these tools required a high-throughput system for publishing data and subscribing to topics.</p><p>Kafka was born out of this need. Over time, Kafka’s importance within LinkedIn has only grown. Kafka plays a central role for services, log management, data engineering, and compliance. LinkedIn might be the biggest user of Apache Kafka in the entire software industry. Kafka has many use cases, and it is likely that they are almost all on display within LinkedIn.</p><p>Nacho Solis is a senior software engineering manager at LinkedIn, where he helps teams build infrastructure for Kafka, as well as Kafka itself.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>A high volume of data can contain a high volume of useful information. That fact is well understood by the software world. Unfortunately, it is not a simple process to surface useful information from this high volume of data. A human analyst needs to understand the business, formulate a question, and determine what metrics could reveal the answer to such a question.</p><p>Sisu is a system for automatically surfacing insights from large data sets within companies. A user of Sisu can select a database column that they are interested in learning more about, and Sisu will automatically analyze the records in the database to look for trends and relationships between that column and the other columns. </p><p>For example, if I have a database of user purchases, including how much money those users spent on each purchase, I can ask Sisu to analyze the purchase price column, and find what kinds of attributes correlate with a high purchase price. Perhaps there will be correlations such as age and city that I can use to understand my customers better. Sisu can automatically surface these correlations and display them to me to help me make business decisions.</p><p>Peter Bailis is the CEO of Sisu Data and an assistant professor at Stanford. Peter joins the show to give his perspective on the development of Sisu, which came out of his research on data-intensive systems, including MacroBase, an analytic monitoring engine that prioritizes human attention.</p>',

The operational analyst needs to be able to query the data to quickly create a dashboard, make judgments based on that dashboard, and then change the query slightly to look at a slightly different dashboard.</p><p>Druid is a high-performance database that is used for these kinds of queries. Druid is used for ad-hoc queries and operational analytics. Imply Data is a company that builds visualization, monitoring, and security around Druid. Jad Naous is vice president of R&amp;D for Imply, and he joins the show to talk about the use case for Druid, the architecture, and the business model of Imply.</p><p>If you enjoy the show, you can find all of our past episodes about data infrastructure by going to <a href="https://www.softwaredaily.com/">SoftwareDaily.com</a> and searching for the technologies or companies mentioned.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Crash monitoring emerged as a software category over the last decade.</p><p>Crash monitoring software allows developers to understand when their applications are crashing on client devices. For example, we have an app for Software Engineering Daily that people download on Android or iOS. Users download the app to their smartphone. When the user is playing an episode, and the app crashes, the details of the crash are sent to a server that collects all of these crash reports.</p><p>Crash reports allow a company to understand where their application is breaking on client devices. This is important, since there are so many client surfaces to test, from iOS to Android to browsers.</p><p>As a business, crash monitoring is a category that has some similarities to log management. There are lots of companies that offer crash monitoring. At first glance, it seems like a simple problem to solve. It seems like a market without winner-take-all or winner-take-most dynamics. But at scale, crash monitoring becomes a deeply complex engineering problem. From indexing to database choices to complex distributed systems tradeoffs, crash monitoring is not a simple business, and it promises to provide an extremely good business for the few companies who are able to out-execute the crowded market.</p><p>James Smith is the CEO of Bugsnag, a company that makes crash monitoring and application stability tools. James returns to the show to discuss the growth-stage engineering challenges of error monitoring, and the business opportunities that come with them.</p>',

Deployment errors can cause an application backend to get DDoS’d.</p><p>When an event happens that prevents your company from operating as expected, it is known as an incident. Software teams respond to an incident by issuing a fix. Sometimes that fix returns the software to its ideal state. Other times the software remains in a degraded state, and it takes more fixing to return the software to the place it should be.</p><p>One way that a software team can learn from an incident is through incident reproduction. When an incident is turned into a reproducible system, it becomes a predictable training exercise rather than a surprising and painful outage.</p><p>Tammy Butow is an engineer with Gremlin, a company that makes chaos engineering software. Chaos engineering is the process of creating controlled experiments that simulate outages. Tammy joins the show to discuss common incident types, and how those can be made reproducible for training exercises.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>A data platform contains all of the data that a company has accumulated over the years. Across a data platform, there is a multitude of data sources: databases, a data lake, data warehouses, a distributed queue like Kafka, and external data sources like Salesforce and Zendesk.</p><p>A user of the data platform often has a question that requires multiple data sources to answer. How does this user join two data sources from a data lake? How does this user join data across a transactional database and a data lake? How does the user join data from two different data warehouse technologies? </p><p>Presto is an open source tool originally developed at Facebook. Presto allows a user to query a data platform with a SQL statement. That query gets parsed and executed across the data platform to read from any heterogeneous data source. For some use cases, Presto is replacing the technology Hadoop MapReduce-based technology Hive. For other use cases, Presto is solving a problem in a completely novel way.</p><p>Justin Borgman joins the show to discuss the motivation for Presto, the problems it solves, and the architecture of Presto. He also talks about the company he started, Starburst Data, which sells and supports technologies built around Presto.</p><p>If you enjoy the show, you can find all of our past episodes about data infrastructure by going to <a href="https://www.softwaredaily.com/">SoftwareDaily.com</a> and searching for the technologies or companies mentioned. And if there is a subject that you want to hear covered, feel free to leave a comment on the episode, or send us a tweet @software_daily.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Edge computing is the usage of servers that are geographically close to the client device.</p><p>The first common use case for edge computing was CDNs: content-delivery networks. A content delivery network placed media files such as images and videos on multiple servers throughout the world. These are big files, and they take lots of bandwidth to transfer. By placing them at CDNs, the files would be closer to any user around the world.</p><p>These early use cases for edge computing were purely about storing large files. But the vast majority of compute still took place at the central application servers.</p><p>Over time, users have required faster and faster application experiences. Today, an increasing amount of compute has been moved to the edge, in addition to the existing storage applications. More user data is being cached at the edge to make for quicker transactional processing. Machine learning model training and hosting at the edge makes for a faster, more responsive machine learning feedback loop.</p><p>Jaromir Coufal is an engineer with Red Hat. He joins the show to talk about modern applications of edge computing, and how the demand for edge computing is creating a market opportunity for companies that have lots of servers at the edge, such as telecoms. These telecoms can repurpose their widely distributed telecom infrastructure as edge servers that they can sell usage on.</p>',

Imagine if large content sites like Netflix or YouTube did not have centralized hosting, and instead relied on its users to seed the content to each other using their web clients.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>freeCodeCamp was started five years ago with the goal of providing free coding education to anyone on the Internet.</p><p>freeCodeCamp has become the best place to begin learning how to write software. There are many other places that a software engineer should visit on their educational journey, but freeCodeCamp is the best place to start, because it is free, and there are no advertisements. </p><p>For most people learning to code, the price of that education is important, because they are learning to code to build a new career. It’s also important that a new programmer learns from an unbiased source of information, because an ad-supported environment will educate the new programmer towards products that they might not need.</p><p>freeCodeCamp has not been easy to build. Building freeCodeCamp has required expertise in software engineering, business, media, and community development. The donation-based business model of freeCodeCamp doesn’t collect very much money. Why would somebody build a non-profit when they could spend their time building a highly profitable software company?</p><p>Quincy Larson is the founder of freeCodeCamp, and he joins the show for a special episode about his backstory and the journey to building the best place on the Internet for a new programmer to begin.</p><p><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/donate/">Support freeCodeCamp</a></p>',

Some teams might email files to each other or use FTP or even floppy disks. Most companies today at least use version control systems like Git together with separate servers for development and production. When code is ready to move to production, a build that is on the development server gets copied over to the production servers, and the production servers begin serving real users.</p><p>This process is known as deployment, and over the last few decades companies have started deploying more rapidly (even “continuously”), leading to faster iterations and better feedback loops between the software development team and the users of the product. A particularly effective version of this workflow is known as continuous delivery.</p><p>In today’s episode, David Rice from ThoughtWorks joins the show to give a short history of continuous delivery, and how continuous delivery actually looks in practice.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Distributed stream processing systems are used to read large volumes of data and perform operations across those data streams. </p><p>These stream processing systems often build off of the MapReduce algorithm for collecting and aggregating large volumes of data, but instead of processing a calculation over a single large batch of data, they process data on an ongoing basis. There are so many different stream processing system for this same use case–Storm, Spark, Flink, Heron, and many others. </p><p>Why is that? When there seems to be much more consolidation around the Hadoop MapReduce batch processing technology, why are there so many stream processing systems?</p><p>One explanation is that aggregating the results of a continuous stream of data is a process that very much depends on time. At any given point in time, you can take a snapshot of the stream of data, and any calculation based on that data is going to be out of date by the time that your calculation is finished. There is a latency between when you start calculating something, and when you finish calculating it.</p><p>There are other design decisions for a distributed stream processing system. What data do you keep in memory? What do you keep on disk? How often do you snapshot your data to disk? What is the method for fault tolerance? What are the APIs for consuming and processing this data?</p><p>Maximilian Michels has worked on the Apache Flink and Apache BEAM stream processing systems, and currently works on data infrastructure at Lyft. Max joins the show to discuss the tradeoffs of different stream processing systems and his experiences in the world of data processing.</p><p>You can find all of our past episodes about data infrastructure by going to <a href="https://www.softwaredaily.com/">SoftwareDaily.com</a> and searching for the technologies or companies mentioned.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Serverless computing abstracts away the idea of a server node. Serverless lets programmers treat compute resources as high-level, reliable APIs, rather than unreliable, low-level compute nodes that might fail.</p><p>Serverless dramatically improves the efficiency of programmers. Instead of thinking of a database as a set of servers that need to be sharded and replicated, the programmer can think of a database as a place to read and write data. Instead of modeling an application as a large monolith running on an application server in a container or a VM, the programmer can think of their application as a decoupled set of functions.</p><p>Serverless computing is a natural evolution of software engineering in a world with cloud providers. The first version of FaaS came out of AWS with their Lambda service, which allows users to run functions in the cloud. Those functions are scheduled onto a physical server somewhere in an Amazon data center. They are executed, and they return the result.</p><p>With AWS Lambda, programmers got a new abstraction to model their applications with. But it requires the use of a closed-source API. Lambda is not open source, and this makes some developers reluctant to integrate with it too tightly.</p><p>Fission is an open source framework for serverless functions built on Kubernetes. Fission allows developers to deploy functions-as-a-service without being locked in to any specific cloud provider. </p><p>Soam Vasani is the creator of Fission and an engineer at Platform9. In a previous episode, Soam talked about the architecture for Fission and the design choices for solving the cold start and scheduling problems. </p><p>Soam joins the show today to discuss how serverless applications have evolved since last spoke more than a year ago. He also talks about how Fission itself has evolved, and the features that an open source serverless platform needs to have in order to compete with a fully developed cloud provider.

Listeners enjoyed that episode, so we decided to do another.</p><p>10 Philosophies was a collection of beliefs I have about the software engineering industry, and how we can find fulfillment in our work as engineers.

You start with two cards, but you don’t know how the board will develop. It would seem that fate is in control, unlike Go and Chess, which have no random elements.</p><p>With just 4 suits and 13 ranks, a poker game has a trivial branching factor. The nondeterminism is so minimal for a computer to plan around that it is effectively deterministic.</p><p>Imagine if AlphaGo had to learn to play a version of Go with the following rule: at the beginning of each turn, flip a coin. If you lose the flip, you don’t get to move. Adjusting to this rule would be trivial. That is the magnitude of nondeterminism within poker.</p><p>Poker, Chess, and Go have small decision spaces. The rules never change, the game pieces never change, there is minimal nondeterminism.</p><p>A computer can assess a hand of poker as it would a hidden Markov model, but it will take work on par with the AlphaGo team for a computer to be trained to build a model accurately.</p><p>The job of a professional poker player has been a bad long-term choice for a human to pursue for more than a decade, because it is vulnerable to automation.</p><p>Games like Go, Poker, and Chess can be automated with machine learning techniques we understand today. The rules, game piece schema, and objectives are easy to define, so these games are ripe for <em>supervised learning</em>and <em>reinforcement learning</em>.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yann_LeCun">Yann LeCun</a> protested against the hype around the AlphaGo victory:</p><p>Poker is vulnerable to the same supervised learning and reinforcement learning techniques that allowed AlphaGo to beat Lee Sedol in Go.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning"><em>Supervised learning</em></a><em> is the machine learning task of inferring a function from labeled training data. </em>Billions of hand histories exist for a poker bot to train on. These hand histories are short and well-schematized, perfect for consumption by an automaton.</p><p><a href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Reinforcement_learning"><em>Reinforcement learning</em></a> <em>is learning by interacting with an environment. </em>Poker bots can test and parallelize their strategies across the thousands of free or cheap poker games on the internet. The <a href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Reward_signals">reward signal</a> of a strategy can be defined as profit over a given time horizon.</p><p>Today, the surviving human professionals cannibalize each other. Before long, even the best of these players will be losing their money to bots.</p><p>Games that cannot be easily solved with simple supervised learning and reinforcement learning will not be automated in the near future. Examples include Magic: the Gathering, Sim City, Minecraft, and Dungeons and Dragons.</p><p>Features of these games include:</p><p>Rules, success, and failure are easy to define in Go, Chess, and Poker.</p><p>In contrast, it is difficult to explain what makes an ideal Minecraft player. Different Minecraft players have different goals and win conditions. We have no way to supervise a computer to succeed at Minecraft, or to reward a computer for its desirable Minecraft behavior.</p><p>Poker has 52 game piece types, Chess has 6, and Go has 1. Magic: the Gathering has 16,000+ unique cards. We don’t know how to teach a computer to understand the complex strategic relationships among these 16,000 different card types.</p><p>Dungeons and Dragons is cooperative, positive sum, highly random, and oriented around subjective player goals. A computer won’t rival the creative, utilitarian humanism of a talented dungeon master any time soon, because we don’t have a good way to codify the traits of a successful game of Dungeons and Dragons.</p><p>As humans, these are the games we should be studying and celebrating.</p><p><a href="https://www.quora.com/Is-learning-to-play-poker-worth-it">Go, Chess, and Poker were excellent pastimes before the renaissance of games we have had in the last 30 years. Today, there are better games.</a></p><p>AlphaGo proves that Go is just another routine that can be automated, like fast food preparation or truck driving.</p><p>Rather than spending our time on Chess, Go, or Poker, human time is better spent playing games that mirror activities which a computer has trouble with.</p><p>Choosing a career as a professional poker player today is like choosing to be an Uber driver or an Amazon warehouse worker: you are waiting to be automated away.</p><p><strong>Madness of Crowds</strong></p><p>In both poker and software, market participants confuse <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_analysis">technical analysis</a>with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_analysis">fundamental analysis</a>.</p><p>Pure technical analysts believe dogmatically in the wisdom of the crowds.</p><p>Technical analysts believe there are no secrets, and that all human knowledge about the future is factored into the crowd’s evaluation of the present.</p><p>Reasoning about markets using first principles can lead to decisions that differ from the wisdom of the crowds. This is a form of <em>fundamental </em>analysis.</p><p>In 2003, an accountant turned amateur poker player named Chris Moneymaker won the World Series of Poker. This coincided with ESPN’s increase in video coverage of the event. People started going to restaurants to watch poker like it was the Super Bowl.</p><p>As poker became popular across the world, many unskilled players began playing the game.</p><p>In 2004, any computer-savvy teenager could learn to play poker and take money from the numerous unskilled Americans who were trying to become the next Chris Moneymaker.</p><p>There was a wealth of information about how to win at poker online, and it didn’t require much effort to study enough of that information to be successful.</p><p>For teenagers who were good at online games, it was a gold rush. Teenagers who had skills from games like StarCraft and Magic Online quickly learned poker and began obliterating the unskilled amateurs.</p><p>In 2006 the online poker bubble sprung a leak with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unlawful_Internet_Gambling_Enforcement_Act_of_2006">passage of the UIGEA</a>. The Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 made it difficult for amateur players to fund their online poker accounts with credit cards.</p><p>In 2008 the global economy collapsed, further reducing the number of casual gamblers on the Internet.</p><p>In 2011 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Scheinberg">Black Friday</a> occurred and it was discovered that Full Tilt Poker was a Ponzi scheme.</p><p>Since 2006, online poker has gotten increasingly difficult, and an ever growing number of poker players have complained about the macro environment of poker.</p><p>Google Trends says that poker popularity has dropped by 80% following the passage of UIGEA in late 2006.</p><p>Since 2006, poker players have been saying: “there are no more weak amateurs. We are all fighting each other, and because we all have the same strategies, we are essentially flipping coins against each other. Poker has become a game of complete variance.”</p><p>None of this matters to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Cates">Dan Cates</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_McDonald_%28poker_player%29">Mike McDonald</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrik_Antonius">Patrik Antonius</a>. Their strategy is sufficiently better than their opposition that they have a<em>fundamental </em>opportunity. They have continued to win despite a steep increase in competition.</p><p>Average poker players who are not innovative nor resilient viewed the events of 2006–2011 as <em>fundamental </em>threats to their viability as professional poker players, when in fact these problems were <em>technical </em>in nature.</p><p>The details of the market changed, but the <em>fundamental </em>opportunity remained: the best players still have enough of an edge to make a great living playing poker.</p><p>When investors and entrepreneurs talk about a “bubble” in Silicon Valley, they are talking about a <em>technical </em>bubble. Not a <em>fundamental </em>bubble.</p><p>Cheap cloud computing, mobile phones, emerging markets of China and India, social networks, Docker, Bitcoin, supply chain economics, drones, fintech, virtual reality: these are <em>fundamental </em>opportunities with huge growth potential.</p><p>When investors and entrepreneurs talk about how “<a href="http://recode.net/2015/08/20/bill-gurley-to-unicorns-winter-is-coming-you-ready/">Winter Is Coming</a>”, what are the cited underpinnings of their panic?</p><p><em>Technical </em>analysis that has little to do with the viability of growth-driving breakthrough technology.</p><p>Institutional investors pulling out of private markets? China being a house of cards? Oil? Greece? <em>Technical </em>chart patterns of 1999 showing a run-up that mirrors modern private markets? Food delivery startups being propped up by other startups?</p><p>There is no surer sign of the madness of crowds than when investors look to each other rather than fundamentals as they try to divine the true nature of private markets.</p><p>Investors who claim to pride themselves on long-term thinking often forget the technological fundamentals that determine long-term viability of companies.</p><p>From 2006 to 2011, thousands of professional poker players quit the game, convinced that a certain popular narrative was true: poker had finally become a game of luck.</p><p>Weak poker players quit as the bubble popped because they were convinced that poker had become so competitive that it was impossible to have an effective, differentiated strategy.</p><p>Poker players who have faith in their own creativity continue to make a living through hard work and study.</p><p>In the near future, the <a href="https://www.bvp.com/portfolio/anti-portfolio">antiportfolios</a> of herd-mentality technology investors will swell at unprecedented rates as investors mistakenly look to each other for guidance, rather than looking at the fundamental opportunities afforded by our current technological boom.</p><p><strong>Emotional Labor</strong></p><p>In 2004 and 2005, college students and well-educated yuppies started playing poker because it was a low-risk, easy way to make money. Wealthy, amateur American poker players were losing money to these college students and yuppies.</p><p>There was a huge difference in skill between these two classes of players.</p><p>The college students and yuppies read books about statistics, psychology, and complex poker strategy. The wealthy, amateur Americans watched poker on TV and tried to copy what they saw professionals doing on the screen.</p><p>For the well-educated college students and yuppies, the only requirement for succeeding at high-stakes poker was patience.</p><p>Patience was important because the wealthy, amateur Americans played so poorly that a college student could sit around waiting for opportunities to get money into the pot with a 10:1 advantage.</p><p>From 2006 to 2011, legislative and economic circumstances pushed many of the amateur American players out of the game. As the wealthy amateurs disappeared from poker, the high-stakes field became 95% professionals.</p><p>In 2005, an average 6-handed online poker table contained 3 professionals and 3 amateurs. In 2006, an average table contained 4 professionals, 1 skilled amateur, and 1 weak amateur. By 2008, most tables were entirely filled with professionals and skilled amateurs.</p><p>Weak opponents were nowhere to be found.</p><p>In this new world of almost entirely professional poker players, emotional resilience was more important than patience.</p><p>Professional players could no longer wait for a clear 10:1 or 5:1 advantage over their opponents. The timid college students and yuppies who maintained a patient, uncreative strategy started to lose money.</p><p>Chaotic, hyperaggressive players began to force games in a direction with increased variance, making their opponents call into question their presumed risk-of-ruin. The most extreme example of this was Viktor Blom, a high-stakes player whose willingness to go broke seemed to exceed his fear, leading to a style where he would frequently <a href="http://www.flopturnriver.com/poker-dictionary/overbet.php">overbet</a> the pot.</p><p>A professional playing against Viktor Blom knew that more money would be<a href="http://www.cardrunners.com/images/jun20%281%29.png">lost</a> or <a href="http://www.pokernews.com/news/2009/12/pokernews-exclusive-isildur1-speaks-about-the-4-million-7714.htm">won</a> in a short time frame than against anyone else.</p><p>For Viktor Blom, the primary cost of using this strategy was that emotional control is harder to maintain when you are winning and losing millions of dollars on a more frequent basis than your opponents.</p><p>The tradeoff was worth it. Viktor Blom’s brilliant strategy gave him both a<a href="http://andr3w321.com/overbet-math/">mathematical advantage </a>and a <a href="https://www.highstakesdb.com/6676-the-effect-of-isildur1.aspx">reputation advantage</a>.</p><p>Why is this relevant to software engineering?</p><p>Viktor Blom gained massive competitive advantage by committing <em>emotional labor</em>.</p><p>He deliberately played poker in a way that was uncomfortable to everyone at the table, because he judged himself as more capable of dealing with that discomfort than everyone else.</p><p>Most software engineers avoid emotional labor.</p><p>When software engineers choose to work at a large corporation because it seems luxurious and safe, they are making a mistake. There has never been a better time for engineers to take extreme risks with their careers.</p><p>Software engineers are incredibly privileged. Our 9–5 jobs are enjoyable and creative, and many of us have significant free time to do whatever we want. During their free time, software engineers should stretch themselves and exert emotional labor, and see what they are capable of.</p><p>In 2005, professional poker players had the option to live a carefree lifestyle. We assumed the gold rush of online poker would never end. Many of us acted irresponsibly with money, as if we would be able to make $30,000 a month for the rest of our lives.</p><p>When the poker economy collapsed, many professional poker players’ lives collapsed with it. We had gotten accustomed to The Good Life, but we hadn’t worked hard enough to capitalize fully on the opportunity at hand.</p><p>Poker players who worked hard and worked smart during the 2003–2007 boom years were able to survive the bust.</p><p>Most poker players did not work hard and smart during the boom.</p><p>Most poker players did not practice <em>emotional labor</em> in 2005, when the game was easy. When poker became difficult in 2008, these players were fragile. Most professional poker players were unable to adapt to the newly competitive landscape.</p><p>In contrast, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Blom">Viktor Blom got used to high-risk activity around 2005, shortly after he started to play poker:</a></p><p>Viktor Blom went broke twice as a teenager.</p><p>Going broke is not always virtuous. For some poker players, being broke is an addiction. They will make a career out of the manic-depressive cycle of building huge piles of money, only to lose it all.</p><p>Viktor Blom became <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragile#Introduction">antifragile</a> from his early experiences going broke.</p><p>This was long before his winning streak in 2009. When the poker economy collapsed, it didn’t severely affect Viktor Blom because he had been forcefully challenging himself for years before.</p><p>In the early days of his career, Viktor relentlessly took risks. The strength of the 2005 poker economy allowed him to rebuild his bankroll each time he went broke.</p><p>Software engineers today should be acting like Viktor Blom in 2005.</p><p>In 2005, Viktor could lose his entire bankroll playing high stakes, it was easy to rebuild at mid-stakes games. By increasing short-term risk of ruin, he decreased long-term risk of ruin.</p><p>In 2016, a software engineer can quit a corporate job and build side projects for 6 months. If none of the side projects turns into a marketable product, that engineer can always go back to the corporation, and can probably ask for a higher salary thanks to the new skills learned from working on those side projects.</p><p>Risk taking is an act of <em>emotional labor</em>.</p><p>Software engineers can build a product, start a business, write an algorithm, launch a rocket, or program a self-driving car. All of these activities require risk. But many software engineers spend their spare time doing activities with very low risk.</p><p>If you commit to being a software engineer who is willing to take risks and commit to emotional labor, you can easily stand out from others.</p><p><strong>Build Your Own Ship</strong></p><p>I spent my <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-to-earn-a-living-through-poker/answer/Jeff-Meyerson?srid=po1Y&amp;share=d4c57ed4">late teenage years playing poker</a> and didn’t write a line of code until my early twenties. Most of the successful engineers I know were coding during their teens.</p><p>In order to catch up, I have had to leverage the skills I learned playing poker.</p><p>Many new engineers today are faced with the same problem.</p><p>You are learning to code as a second career, and it can feel very difficult because it feels like you are throwing away everything from the past and starting from scratch.</p><p>Whether you are trained as a barista, a salesperson, or a biologist, you must find skills from your past that you can carry into your career as a software engineer.</p><p>A barista is great at sequencing operations that are less trivial than they seem. A salesperson understands how to work with clients and cater to their needs in high-stakes projects. A biologist understands abstractions, and how to think about individual parts of a system in isolation.</p><p>Being an outsider is a disadvantage at first, but over time it has tremendous value.</p><p>Every job you have had in the past has transferrable skills that can be applied to software engineering. Identifying the advantages you have developed from your past experiences can help you feel more confident.</p><p>When you start out as a software engineer, many developers will tell you what to do and how you should act.</p><p>These people say: Learn JavaScript. Go to a coding boot camp. Write tests for all your code. Learn to make mobile apps. Use StackOverflow. Learn functional programming. Become a master of the command line.</p><p>Every person learns software engineering differently.</p><p>Software engineering is an art. To succeed as artists, we have to decide what tools and methodologies we want to use. We have to decide <em>for ourselves.</em></p><p>Poker is also an art. There is no objectively “best” way to play poker. Poker players develop their art form through years of subjective experience.</p><p>Haseeb Qureshi described this in “Poker as Shipbuilding”, a section from his masterpiece <a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Be-Poker-Player-Philosophy-ebook/dp/B00HFDJU6A/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1458343923&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=philosophy+of+poker">The Philosophy of Poker</a>:</p><p>As a poker player, I failed because I copied what I saw other people doing without understanding the reasoning behind it. I did not build my own ship as a poker player.</p><p>If your strategy is to copy others, you cannot differentiate yourself from the global talent pool. You cannot differentiate yourself from the machines that are getting smarter every day.</p><p>As a software engineer, I try not to make the mistake of blindly copying what is fashionable. A decade ago, I lost most of my money because I was simply following what others were doing.</p><p>It is useful to have such a history of pain associated with copying others.</p><p>For most people, blindly copying others alleviates pain. When I feel like I am copying others without understanding why, my gut response is to be ashamed and scared of own tendency to replicate.</p><p>If you don’t copy the behavior of other engineers, your manager cannot treat you as a highly predictable commodity. You can’t be spun up and assigned to a task like an EC2 cluster.</p><p>If you aren’t a highly predictable commodity, you will probably be fired or promoted.</p><p>Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-are-entrepreneurs-bad-employees/answer/Auren-Hoffman">most companies are not set up to support or encourage entrepreneurial behavior</a>.</p><p>Many software engineers end up stuck in jobs that make them unhappy because they simply take orders and do not think through things themselves, considering all their options, and seeing the bigger picture.</p><p><a href="http://softwaredaily.wpengine.com/2016/02/12/10-philosophies-for-developers/">Software engineers need to build their own ships.</a></p><p>If your strategy as a software engineer is to only copy what you have already seen, you will follow people into old technologies. You will start companies in crowded markets. You will find yourself surrounded by other people who are afraid to create their own strategies, technologies, and products.</p><p>If you build your own ship, the world is full of opportunity.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Twenty years ago, all of the data in an organization could fit inside of relational databases. </p><p>Imagine a company like Proctor and Gamble. P&amp;G is a consumer packaged goods company with hundreds of business sectors–shaving products, toothpaste, shampoo, laundry detergent.</p><p>Twenty years ago, if the chief financial officer of P&amp;G wanted to answer a question about the revenue projections within the enterprise, that CFO would ask a VP to find the answer. The VP would contact the business analysts in all the different departments within Procter and Gamble, and those business analysts would all work with database administrators to answer questions for their business sector. In that world, it might have taken weeks or months for the CFO to get the answer about revenue projections.</p><p>Today, data engineering has improved dramatically. Data sets within an enterprise are updated more rapidly. The tooling has advanced thanks to the Hadoop project leading to a wide range of open source projects that feed into one another.</p><p>But data problems across an enterprise still exist. Business analysts, data scientists, and data engineers struggle to communicate with each other. The CFO still can’t get a question about revenue projections answered instantly. Instead of instant answers, we live in a world of friction, batch processing, and monthly reports. </p><p>And this is not just true of old enterprises like P&amp;G. It is true of newer startups like Uber, Airbnb, and Netflix. It seems that no amount of engineers and financial windfall can completely cure the frictions of the modern data platform.</p><p>Tomer Shiran started Dremio to address the long-lived problems of data management, data access, and data governance within an enterprise. Dremio connects databases, storage systems, and business intelligence tools together, and uses intelligent caching to make commonly used queries within an organization more readily accessible. </p><p>Dremio is an ambitious project that spent several years in stealth before launching. In today’s episode, Tomer gives a history of data engineering, and provides his perspective on how the data problems within an organization can be diminished.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Engineers in Silicon Valley see a world of constant progress. Our work is creative and intellectually challenging. We are building the future and getting compensated quite well for it. </p><p>But what if we are actually achieving far less than what is possible? What if, after so many years of high margins, gourmet lunch, and self-flattery, we have lowered our standards for innovation? And if Silicon Valley has been lulled into complacency, what does that say about the rest of the United States?</p><p>American exceptionalism has faltered and complacency has risen in its wake.</p><p>Today’s guest Tyler Cowen is an economist and author. His new book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Complacent-Class-Self-Defeating-Quest-American/dp/1250108691">The Complacent Class</a> is the final book in a trilogy that describes a decline of American output and a decline in American mindset.</p><p>Complacent America has lost its ability to assess risk. Children are prevented from playing tag for risk of injury. College students protest against speakers who might present challenging ideas. The number of Americans under 30 who own a business has fallen by 65% since the 1980’s–millennials are too busy going to business school to start businesses.</p><p>In his books, Tyler weaves together history, philosophy, and contemporary culture. He presents hard data about many different fields, and theorizes about how the trends in those fields relate to each other.</p><p>He also has a podcast, <a href="https://www.mercatus.org/commentary/conversations-tyler">Conversations with Tyler</a>, and in this episode I tried to mirror his interview style. If you like this episode, you should check out his show–he has interviewed people like Ezra Klein, Peter Thiel, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Kubernetes has become the standard way of deploying new distributed applications. </p><p>Most new internet businesses started in the foreseeable future will leverage Kubernetes (whether they realize it or not). Many old applications are migrating to Kubernetes too. </p><p>Before Kubernetes, there was no standardization around a specific distributed systems platform. Just like Linux became the standard server-side operating system for a single node, Kubernetes has become the standard way to orchestrate all of the nodes in your application.</p><p>With Kubernetes, distributed systems tools can have network effects. Every time someone builds a new tool for Kubernetes, it makes all the other tools better. And it further cements Kubernetes as the standard.</p><p>Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and IBM each have a Kubernetes-as-a-service offering, making it easier to shift infrastructure between the major cloud providers. We are likely to see Digital Ocean, Heroku, and longer tail cloud providers offer a managed, hosted Kubernetes eventually.</p><p>In this editorial, I explore the following questions:</p><p>Standardized software platforms are both good and bad. </p><p>Standards allow developers to have expectations around how their software will run. If a developer builds something for a standardized platform, they can make smart estimations about the total addressable market for that piece of software.</p><p>If you write a program in JavaScript, you know that it will run in everyone’s browser. If you create a game for iOS, you know that everyone with an iPhone will be able to download it. If you build a tool for profiling garbage collection in .NET, you know that there is a large community of Windows developers with memory issues who can buy your software.</p><p>Standardized proprietary platforms can lead to massive profit returns for the platform provider. In 1995, Windows was such a good platform that Microsoft could sell a CD in a cardboard box for $100. In 2018, the iPhone is so good that Apple can take 30% from all app sales on its platform. </p><p>Proprietary standards lead to fragmentation.</p><p>Your iPhone app does not run on my Kindle Fire. I can’t use your Snapchat augmented reality sticker on Facebook Messenger. My <a href="https://www.image-line.com/flstudio/">favorite digital audio workstation</a> only runs on Windows–so I have to keep a Windows computer around just to make music.</p><p>When developers see this fragmentation, they groan. They imagine the greedy capitalists, who are making money at the expense of software quality.  Developers think, “why can’t we all just get along? Why can’t we have things be open and free?”</p><p>Developers think, “we don’t need proprietary standards. We can have open standards.”</p><p>Growth of Apache, part of the LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) Stack </p><p>This happened with Linux. These days, new server side applications are mostly in Linux. There was a time when that was controversial (see the far left hand side of chart above).</p><p>More recently, we saw a newer open standard with Docker. Docker gave us an open, standardized way of packaging, deploying, and distributing a single node. This was hugely valuable! But for all of the big problems that Docker solved, it highlighted a new problem–how should we be orchestrating these nodes together?</p><p>After all–your application is not just a single node. You know you want to be deploying a Docker container–but how are your containers communicating with each other? How are you scaling up instances of these containers? How are you routing traffic between container instances?</p><p>After Docker became popular, a scramble of open source projects and proprietary platforms emerged to solve the problem of container orchestration. </p><p>Mesos, Docker Swarm, and Kubernetes each offered a different set of abstractions for managing containers. Amazon ECS offered a proprietary managed service that took care of installation and scaling of Docker containers for AWS users.</p><p>Some developers did not adopt any orchestration platform, and used BASH, Puppet, Chef, and other tools to script their deployments. </p><p>Whether a developer was deploying their container by using an orchestration platform or a script, Docker sped up development, and made things more harmonious between developers and operations. </p><p>As more developers deployed containers with Docker, the importance of the orchestration platform was becoming clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/gCQfFXSHSxw?t=611">A container is as fundamental to a distributed system as an object is to an object oriented program</a>. Everyone wanted to be using a container platform, but there was a struggle between these platforms, and it was hard to see which would come out on top–or if it would be a decades long struggle, like iOS vs. Android.</p><p>This struggle between the different container orchestration platforms was causing fragmentation–not because any of the popular orchestration frameworks were proprietary (Swarm, Kubernetes, and Mesos are all open source), but because each container orchestration community had invested so much in their own system.</p><p>So, from 2013 – 2016, there was some anxiety among Docker power users. Choosing a container orchestration framework is a huge bet–and if you chose the wrong orchestration system, it would be like opening a movie store and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-definition_optical_disc_format_war">choosing HD DVD over Blu-ray</a>. <a href="https://i0.wp.com/softwareengineeringdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/pasted-image-0-4.png"></a></p><p>These pictures of container ships falling over never get old. Image: Huffington Post</p><p>The war between container orchestrators felt like a winner-take-all affair. </p><p>And as in any war, there was a fog that was hard to see through. When I was reporting on container orchestration wars, I recorded <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/tag/containers/">podcast after podcast with container orchestration experts</a>, where I would ask some form of the question, “so, which container orchestration system is going to win?”</p><p>I did this until <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2016/07/06/schedulers-with-adrian-cockcroft/">someone I respect</a> told me that asking about who was going to “win the orchestration wars” was a less interesting question than evaluating the technical tradeoffs between the orchestrators. </p><p>Looking back, I regret buying into the narrative of a war between container orchestrators. </p><p>As the debates about container orchestrators raged on, the smartest people in the room were mostly having calm, scientific discussions–even when reporters like me were getting worked up, and thinking that this was a story about tribalism. </p><p>The conflicts between container orchestrators were not about tribalism–they were more about differences of opinion, and developer ergonomics.</p><p>OK, maybe the container orchestration war wasn’t only about differences of opinion. There is a boatload of money to be made in this space. We are talking about contracts with billion dollar legacy organizations–banks, and telcos, and insurance companies–who are making their way onto the cloud.</p><p>If you are in the business of helping telcos move onto the winning platform, business is good. If you champion the wrong platform, you end up with a warehouse full of HD-DVDs.</p><p>The time where the conflict was the worst was near the end of 2016, when there were <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2016/10/03/docker-fork-with-alex-williams-and-joab-jackson/">rumors about Docker potentially forking, so that Docker the company could change the Docker standard to fit better with their container orchestration system Docker Swarm</a>–but even in those times, it would have made sense to be an optimist. </p><p>Creative destruction is painful, but it is a sign of progress–and in the struggle for container orchestration dominance, there was a ton of creative destruction. </p><p>And when the dust cleared around the end of 2016, Kubernetes was the clear winner.</p><p>Today, with Kubernetes becoming the safe choice, CIOs feel more comfortable adopting container orchestration at their enterprises–which makes vendors feel more comfortable investing in Kubernetes-specific tools to sell to those CIOs.</p><p>This brings us to the present:</p><p>Today, the most lucrative provider of proprietary backend developer infrastructure is Amazon Web Services. Developers do not view AWS resentfully, because AWS is innovative, empowering, and cheap. If you are paying AWS a lot of money, that probably means your business is doing well.</p><p>With AWS, developers do not feel the level of lock-in that was administered by the dominant proprietary platforms of the 90s. But there is some lock-in. Once you are deeply embedded in the AWS ecosystem, using services like DynamoDB, Amazon Elastic Container Service, or Amazon Kinesis, it becomes a daunting task to move away from Amazon.</p><p>With Kubernetes creating an open, common layer for infrastructure, it becomes theoretically possible to “lift and shift” your Kubernetes cluster from one cloud provider to another. </p><p>If you decided to lift-and-shift your application, you would have to rewrite parts of your application to stop using the Amazon-specific services (like Amazon S3). For example, if you wanted an S3 replacement that would run on any cloud, you could configure a Kubernetes cluster with <a href="https://rook.io/">Rook</a>, and start to store objects on Rook with the same APIs that you would use to store them on S3.</p><p>This is a nice option to have, but I have not yet heard of anyone actually lifting and shifting their application away from a cloud–<a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2016/05/17/dropboxs-magic-pocket-james-cowling/">except for Dropbox</a>, and their migration was <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/03/epic-story-dropboxs-exodus-amazon-cloud-empire/">so epic it took two and a half years</a>. </p><p>Certainly there is someone out there other than Dropbox who spends so much money on Amazon S3 that they will consider spinning up their own object store, but it would be a huge effort to do such a migration.</p><p>(Kubernetes can be used for lifting and shifting–but more likely will be used to have familiar operating layer in different clouds)</p><p>Kubernetes probably won’t be a tool for widespread lifting and shifting any time soon. A more likely scenario is that Kubernetes will become a ubiquitous control plane, that enterprises will use on multiple clouds. </p><p>NodeJS is a useful analogy. Why do people like NodeJS for their server side applications? It’s not necessarily because Node is the fastest web server. It’s because people like to use the same language on both the client and the server. Just like NodeJS lets you move between your client and server code without having to switch languages, Kubernetes will let you switch between clouds without having to change how you think about operations.</p><p>On each cloud, you will have some custom application code running on Kubernetes that interacts with the managed services provided by that cloud.</p><p>Companies want to be multi-cloud–partly for disaster recovery, but also because there is actual upside to having access to managed services on the different clouds.</p><p>One emerging pattern is to split infrastructure between AWS for user traffic and Google Cloud for data engineering. One company that uses this pattern is <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2017/11/28/thumbtack-infrastructure-with-nate-kupp/">Thumbtack</a>:</p><p>At Thumbtack, the production infrastructure on AWS serves user requests. The log of transactions that occur get pushed from AWS to Google Cloud, where the data engineering occurs. On Google Cloud, the transaction records are queued in Cloud PubSub, a message queueing service. Those transactions are pulled off the queue and stored in BigQuery, a system for storage and querying of high volumes of data.<br>\n<br>\nBigQuery is used as the data lake to pull from when orchestrating machine learning jobs. These machine learning jobs are run in Cloud Dataproc, a managed service that runs Apache Spark. After training a model in Google Cloud, that model is deployed on the AWS side, where it serves user traffic. On the Google Cloud side, the orchestration of these different managed services is done by Apache Airflow, an open source tool that is one of the few pieces of infrastructure that Thumbtack does have to manage themselves on Google Cloud.</p><p>Today, Thumbtack uses AWS for serving user requests and Google Cloud for data engineering and queueing in PubSub. Thumbtack trains its machine learning models in Google, and deploys them to AWS.</p><p>This is just the way things are today. Thumbtack might eventually use Google Cloud for user-facing services as well.</p><p>(a multi-cloud data engineering pipeline from a Japanese company)</p><p>More companies will gradually move towards multiple clouds–and some of them will manage a unique Kubernetes cluster on each cloud. </p><p>You might have a GKE Kubernetes cluster on Google to orchestrate workloads between BigQuery, Cloud PubSub, and Google Cloud ML, and you might have an Amazon EKS cluster to orchestrate workloads between DynamoDB, Amazon Aurora, and your production NodeJS application.</p><p>Cloud providers are not replaceable commodities. The services provided by the different clouds will get increasingly exotic and differentiated. Enterprises will benefit from having access to the different services on the different cloud providers.</p><p>Services like Google BigQuery and AWS Redshift are popular because they give you a powerful, scalable, multi-node tool with a simple API. Developers often choose these managed services because they are so easy to use.</p><p>You don’t see these types of paid tools for single nodes. I don’t pay for NodeJS, or React, or Ruby on Rails.</p><p>Tools for a single node are much easier to operate than tools for a distributed system. It’s harder to deploy Hadoop across servers than to run a Ruby on Rails application on my laptop. With Kubernetes, this is going to change.</p><p>If you are using Kubernetes, you can use a distributed systems package manager called Helm. This is like npm for Kubernetes applications. If you are using Kubernetes, you can use Helm to easily install a complicated multi-node application, no matter what cloud provider you are on.</p><p>Here’s a description of Helm: </p><p>A package manager for distributed systems. Amazing! Let’s take a look at what I can install.</p><p>Not pictured: WordPress, Jenkins, Kafka</p><p>Distributed systems are hard to set up. Ask anyone who has set up their own Kafka cluster. Helm is going to make installing Kafka as easy as installing a new version of Photoshop on your MacBook. And you will be able to do this on any cloud. </p><p>Before Helm, the closest thing to a distributed systems package manager (that I am aware of) was the marketplace that you find on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace">AWS</a> or <a href="https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/">Azure</a>, or the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/launcher/">Google Cloud Launcher</a>. Here again we see how proprietary software can lead to fragmentation. Before Helm, there was no standard, platform-agnostic way of one-click installing Kafka. </p><p>You can find a way to one-click install Kafka on AWS, Google, or Azure. But each of these installations had to be written independently, for that specific cloud provider. And to install Kafka on Digital Ocean, you need to follow <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-apache-kafka-on-ubuntu-14-04">a 10-step tutorial</a>.</p><p>Helm represents a cross-platform system for distributing multi-node software on any Kubernetes instance. You could use an application installed with Helm in any cloud provider or on your own hardware. You could easily install Apache Spark or Cassandra–systems that are notoriously difficult to set up and operate.</p><p>Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes–but it also looks like the beginnings of an app store for Kubernetes. With an app store, you could sell software for Kubernetes.</p><p>What kind of software could you sell? </p><p>You could sell enterprise distributions of distributed systems platforms like Cloudera Hadoop, Databricks Spark, and Confluent Kafka. New monitoring systems like Prometheus and multi-node databases like Cassandra that are hard to install. </p><p>Maybe you could even sell higher-level, consumer-grade software like Zendesk.</p><p>The idea of a self-hosted Zendesk sounds crazy, but someone could build that, and sell it in the form of a proprietary binary, at the cost of a flat fee instead of a subscription. If I sell you a $99 Zendesk-for-Kubernetes, and you can easily run it on your Kubernetes cluster on AWS, you are going to end up saving a lot of money on support ticketing software.</p><p>Enterprises often run their own WordPress to manage a company blog. Is the software for Zendesk that much more complicated than WordPress? I don’t think so–but enterprises are much more scared of managing their own help desk software than managing their own blogging software.</p><p>I run a pretty small business but I subscribe to a LOT of different software-as-a-service tools. An expensive WordPress host, an expensive CRM for advertising sales, MailChimp for the newsletter. I pay for these services because they are super reliable and secure, and they are complex multi-node applications. I wouldn’t want to host my own. I wouldn’t want to support them. I don’t want to be responsible for technical troubleshooting when my newsletter fails to send. <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2017/11/20/run-less-software-with-rich-archbold/">I want to run less software</a>.</p><p>In contrast, I’m not afraid that my single-node software is going to break.</p><p>Software that I use from a single node tends to be much less expensive because I don’t have to buy it as a “service”. The software that I use to write music has a 1-time fixed cost. Photoshop has a 1-time fixed cost. I pay for the electricity to run my computer, but other than that I have no ongoing capital expense to run Photoshop.</p><p>When multi-node applications are as reliable as single-node applications, we will see changes in the pricing models.</p><p>Maybe someday I will be able to purchase a Zendesk-for-Kubernetes. The Zendesk-for-Kubernetes will give me everything I need from a help desk–it will spin up an email server, it will give me a web frontend to manage tickets. And if anything goes wrong, I can pay for support when I need it.</p><p>Zendesk is a fantastic service–but it would be cool if it had a fixed pricing model</p><p>With Kubernetes, it becomes easier to deploy and manage distributed applications. With Helm, it becomes easier to distribute those applications to other users. But it’s still pretty hard to develop distributed systems. </p><p>This was the focus of a recent CloudNative Con/KubeCon Keynote by Brendan Burns, called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCQfFXSHSxw">“This Job is Too Hard: Building New Tools, Patterns, and Paradigms to Democratize Distributed Systems Development”</a>.</p><p>In his presentation, Brendan presented a project called Metaparticle. Metaparticle is a standard library for cloud-native development, with the goal of democratizing distributed systems. In an <a href="https://metaparticle.io/posts/welcome-to-metaparticle/">introduction to Metaparticle</a>, Brendan wrote:</p><p>After decades of distributed systems research and application, patterns have emerged about how we build these systems. We need a way to do locking of a variable, so that two nodes will not be able to write to that variable in a nondeterministic fashion. We need a way to do master election, so that if the master node dies, the other nodes can pick a new node to orchestrate the system.</p><p>Today, we use tools like etcd and Zookeeper to help us with master election and locking–and these tools have an onboarding cost.</p><p>Brendan illustrates this with the example of Zookeeper, which is used by both Hadoop and Kafka to do master election. Zookeeper takes significant time and effort to learn how to operate. During the construction of both Hadoop and Kafka, the founding engineers of those projects engineered their systems to work with Zookeeper to maintain a master node.</p><p>If I am writing a system to do distributed mapreduce, I would like to avoid thinking about node failures and race conditions. Brendan’s idea is to push those problems down into a standard library–so the next developer who comes along with a new idea for a multi-node application has an easier time.</p><p>Important meta-point: metaparticle is built with the assumption that you are on Kubernetes. This is a language-level abstraction that is built with an assumption about the underlying (distributed) operating system–which once again brings us back to standards. If everyone is on the same distributed operating system, we can make big assumptions about the downstream users of our projects. </p><p>This is why my mind is blown by Kubernetes. It is a layer of standards across a world of heterogeneous systems.</p><p>Functions as a service (often called “serverless” functions) are a powerful, cheap abstraction that developers can use alongside Kubernetes, on top of Kubernetes, and in some cases instead of Kubernetes altogether. </p><p>Let’s quickly review the modern landscape of serverless applications, and then consider the relationship between serverless and Kubernetes. </p><p><a href="https://www.softwaredaily.com/#/post/5a251d5f0cbcbe0004c932e1">Quick review on functions as a service</a>:</p><p>Functions as a service are deployable functions that run without an addressable server.</p><p>Functions as a service deploy, execute, and scale with a single call by the developer. Until you make that call to the serverless function, your function is not running anywhere–so you are not using up resources other than the database that is storing your raw code. When you call a function as a service, your cluster will take care of scheduling and running that function.</p><p>You don’t have to worry about spinning up a new machine and monitoring that machine, and spinning the machine down once it becomes idle. You just tell the cluster that you want to run a function, and the cluster executes it and returns the result.</p><p>When you “deploy” a serverless function, the function code is not actually deployed. Your code sits in a database in plain text. When you call the function, your code is being taken out of the database entry, loaded onto a Docker container, and executed.</p><p>(diagram from <a href="https://medium.com/openwhisk/uncovering-the-magic-how-serverless-platforms-really-work-3cb127b05f71">https://medium.com/openwhisk/uncovering-the-magic-how-serverless-platforms-really-work-3cb127b05f71</a>)</p><p>AWS Lambda pioneered this idea of a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/run-code-cloud/">function-as-a-service in 2014</a>. Since then, developers have been thinking of all kinds of use cases. For a comprehensive list of how developers are using serverless, there is a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UjW8bt5O8QBgQRILJVKZJej_IuNnxl20AJu9wA8wcdI/edit#heading=h.yiaul8is1ki">shared Google Doc created by the CNCF Serverless Working Group (34 pages at the time of this article)</a>.</p><p>From my conversations on Software Engineering Daily, these functions as a service have shown at least two clear applications:</p><p>To create a FaaS platform, a cloud provider provisions a cluster of Docker containers called invokers. Those invokers wait to get blobs of code scheduled onto them. When you make a request for your code to execute, there is a period of time that you have to wait for that code to be loaded onto an invoker and executed. This time spent waiting is the “cold start” problem.</p><p>The cold start problem is one of the tradeoffs that you make if you decide to run part of your application on FaaS. You don’t pay for the uptime of a server that isn’t doing any work–but when you want to call your function, you have to wait for your code to be scheduled onto an invoker.</p><p>On AWS there are invokers designated for whatever requests for AWS Lambda come in. On Microsoft Azure there are invokers designated for Azure Functions requests. On Google Cloud there are invokers reserved for Google Cloud Functions.</p><p>For most developers, using the function-as-a-service platforms from AWS, Microsoft, Google, or IBM will be fine. The costs are low, and the cold start problem is not problematic for most applications. But some developers will want to get costs even lower. Or they might want to write their own scheduler that defines how code gets scheduled onto invoker containers. These developers can roll their own serverless platform.</p><p>Open source FaaS projects such as Kubeless let you provision your own serverless cluster on top of Kubernetes. You can define your own pool of invokers. You can determine how containers are scheduled against jobs. You can decide on how to solve the cold start problem for your own cluster.</p><p>The open source FaaS for Kubernetes are just one type of resource scheduler. They are just a preview of other custom schedulers we will see on top of Kubernetes. Developers are always building new schedulers in order to build more efficient services on top of those schedulers.</p><p>So–what other types of schedulers will be built on top of Kubernetes? Well, as they say, the future is already here, but it’s only available as an AWS managed service.</p><p>AWS has a new service called Amazon Aurora Serverless–which is a database that scales storage and compute up and down automatically. From <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/in-the-works-amazon-aurora-serverless/">Jeff Barr’s post about AWS Serverless Aurora</a>:</p><p> When you create an Aurora Database Instance, you choose the desired instance size and have the option to increase read throughput using read replicas. If your processing needs or your query rate changes you have the option to modify the instance size or to alter the number of read replicas as needed. This model works really well in an environment where the workload is predictable, with bounds on the request rate and processing requirement.</p><p>In some cases the workloads can be intermittent and/or unpredictable, with bursts of requests that might span just a few minutes or hours per day or per week. Flash sales, infrequent or one-time events, online gaming, reporting workloads (hourly or daily), dev/test, and brand-new applications all fit the bill. Arranging to have just the right amount of capacity can be a lot work; paying for it on steady-state basis might not be sensible.</p><p>Because storage and processing are separate, you can scale all the way down to zero and pay only for storage. I think this is really cool, and I expect it to lead to the creations of new kinds of instant-on, transient applications. Scaling happens in seconds, building upon a pool of “warm” resources that are raring to go and eager to serve your requests. </p><p>We are not surprised that AWS can build something like this, but it’s hard to imagine how it could emerge as an open source project—until Kubernetes. This is the type of system that random developers could build on top of Kubernetes.</p><p>If you wanted to build your own serverless database on top of Kubernetes, you’ve got a number of scheduling problems to solve. You need different resource tiers for networking, storage, logging, buffering, and caching. For each of those different resource tiers, you need to define how resources will get scheduled to scale up and down in response to demand.</p><p>Just like Kubeless offers a scheduler for the small bits of functional code, we might see other custom schedulers that people use as building blocks for bigger applications.</p><p>And once you actually build your serverless database, perhaps you could sell it on the Helm app store as a $99 one-time purchase.</p><p>I hope you have enjoyed this tour through some Kubernetes history and speculation about the future.</p><p>As 2018 begins, here are some of the areas we’d like to explore this year:</p><p>Kubernetes is a fantastic tool for building modern application backends–but it is still just a tool. </p><p>If Kubernetes fulfills its mission, it will eventually fade into the background. There will come a time when we talk about Kubernetes like we talk about compilers or operating system kernels. Kubernetes will be lower level plumbing that is not in the purview of the average application developer.</p><p>But until then, we’ll continue to report on it.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>A blockchain is a data structure that provides decentralized, peer-to-peer data distribution. Bitcoin is the most well-known blockchain, but in the next decade we will see many more blockchains. Most listeners probably know that you could just fork the code of Bitcoin to start your own blockchain–but wouldn’t it be nice to know how to build a blockchain from scratch?</p><p>Daniel van Flymen is the author of the Medium article <a href="https://hackernoon.com/learn-blockchains-by-building-one-117428612f46">Learn Blockchains by Building One</a>. In his post, he walks you through how to write the code for a blockchain–just like any other web app. He starts with raw Python code, defines the data structures, and stands up his simple blockchain app on a web server to give a toy example for how nodes in a blockchain communicate.</p><p>For me, this was a great article to read. I have reported on blockchains for over a year, but had not seen such a clear example with executable, simplified code.</p><p><em>Stay tuned at the end of the episode for Jeff Meyerson’s tip about making the most of a new job: brought to you by Indeed Prime.</em></p><p>To find all of our coverage of cryptocurrencies, download <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/software-engineering-daily-podcast-app/id1253734426?mt=8">the Software Engineering Daily app for iOS</a> or Android to hear all of our old episodes.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Decentralized applications might someday offer alternatives to modern monopolies. Uber, Airbnb, Facebook, Amazon—all of these services could be recreated on a decentralized stack of technologies like Ethereum, IPFS, and Golem. Fully decentralized services could be more transparent, cheaper, and more efficient.</p><p>But let’s be realistic. Today, even the simplest applications of fully decentralized blockchains don’t work as well as we need them to. Cryptokitties offered a glimpse into how a simple viral application can limit the throughput of Ethereum. And don’t forget that these technologies are in some ways still subject to centralization in their current form. Miners form the decentralized consensus layer—and that mining activity is physically centralized in large server farms.</p><p>The decentralized future is possible. In order to get there, we need to make progress on the low-level tools that such a world will be built upon. This is the realization that today’s guest Karl Floersh had. Karl is a researcher for the Ethereum Foundation. He was initially excited about the prospect of decentralized apps—such as a decentralized Uber. But as he looked more closely at the space, he realized how early we are, and how much work there is to be done on foundational technologies.</p><p>Proof of Stake is the central topic of discussion in today’s conversation with Karl. Proof of Stake is a consensus mechanism that is an alternative to Proof of Work. In Proof of Work, miners race to validate blocks of transactions. This results in duplicated effort and perhaps wasted energy. In Proof of Stake, validators are chosen to approve transactions. These validators lock up an amount of currency that they are willing to “stake.” If a validator acts badly, the validator will lose their entire stake.</p><p>This mechanism could be more efficient—and we will explain why that is in this episode. If Proof of Stake works, it could lead to a faster, truly decentralized Ethereum blockchain. That’s a remarkable potential outcome.</p><p>Transcript provided by We Edit Podcasts.

We began with a brief history of why Kafka evolved to be the message broker of choice for so many data engineering stacks, then we got into a discussion of streaming–what is streaming? How does Kafka communicate with streaming frameworks? Our conversation concluded with a discussion of Kafka Streams and the future of the Kafka data platform.</p>',

Languages follow well-defined rules, we have lots of sample data to train our machine learning models.</p><p>And yet, the problem has not been solved–largely because languages don’t always follow rules. We have idioms and subtle contextual clues that make it hard to provide a computer with hard and fast rules for translation.</p><p>Unbabel is a company whose solution to translation puts a human in the loop to correct the error-prone translations that computers often make. In this episode, Vasco Pedro joins the show to explain Unbabel’s approach to translation, its technology stack, and the business applications for translation.</p>',

It may feel like the Facebook mission is already finished, because you can already use Facebook to connect with anyone across the world with an Internet connection. </p><p>But once you are connected to somebody on Facebook, there are only a small number of interactions you can take: sending a message, sharing a photo, broadcasting a video stream. There are so many more parts of our lives waiting to be digitized, and many of these require a real identity system to work properly. </p><p>More than any other company, Facebook is positioned to expand our system of real-world human trust onto the Internet. The depth and breadth of the engineering problems required to accomplish this demands that Facebook move fast. To move slower would cause all of us to pay the opportunity cost of having to wait longer to interconnect our global society.</p><p>Pete Hunt worked as an engineer at Facebook for three and a half years. At Facebook, he helped build React, a set of technologies that have significantly improved frontend application interface development. After the Instagram acquisition, Pete was the first engineer from Facebook to join the Instagram team to help bring the two companies together.</p><p>Pete left Facebook in 2014 to start Smyte, a company that made trust and safety tools for marketplaces and social networks. Smyte was acquired by Twitter, where Pete now works on engineering problems relating to trust, safety, health, and infrastructure.</p><p>Pete joins the show for the first of several episodes with Facebook engineers. In these episodes, we will explore the engineering practices of Facebook–from scaling Facebook’s PHP monolith to open sourcing React and GraphQL. Other topics will include management, onboarding, and product strategy.</p><p>Our goal is to present a holistic picture of how Facebook engineering works, so that other organizations can learn to adopt practices that will allow them to move faster.

    'Episodes Pubdate Date': '2018-06-11',
    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Big blocks or small blocks: this is the fundamental question of Bitcoin scalability.</p><p>The argument for big blocks is also known as “on-chain scalability.” Under this strategy, each block in the append-only chain of Bitcoin transaction blocks would grow in size to be able to support lower transaction fees and higher on-chain throughput. A set of Bitcoin users who supported this idea forked Bitcoin to create Bitcoin Cash, a version of Bitcoin that has a larger block size.</p><p>The argument for small blocks asserts that scaling Bitcoin does not require a larger block size. Under this model, the scaling demands of the Bitcoin blockchain would be handled by sidechains. A sidechain is a network of person-to-person payment channels that only reconcile with the Bitcoin blockchain to checkpoint batches of transactions. These sidechains can be connected together to form the “lightning network.”</p><p>Lightning network is hard to implement. To implement a lightning network requires solving real-world distributed systems problems that are unprecedented. It’s much more complicated than deploying a blockchain with a larger block size.</p><p>In addition, opponents of lightning network suggest that this will lead to a centralized banking system being constructed on top of Bitcoin. </p><p>Opponents of lightning network fear that instead of a decentralized payments network, the world with lightning network will be a lower cost version of the present financial system, in which JP Morgan and Blockstream partner up to battle Coinbase in a centralized war for control of the unbanked. </p><p>These big blockers argue that the new banks on the lightning network will be just like the old banks–censorious of transactions and held in the domineering palms of the global financial kleptocracy.</p><p>So why bother with the lightning network approach? Why are we building this inelegant, kludgey system of off-chain, potentially centralized banking 2.0 complexity? Why not just increase the block size indefinitely and keep things simple? And even if we increased the block size today, couldn’t we still deploy lightning network in the future while appeasing the transaction volume of today?</p><p>One major reason is that growing the block size does have a cost. The bigger the block size, the more demands it places on any node that wants to maintain a record of those blocks. And if you grow the block size today, you forego the experiment of seeing whether a small block size plus lightning network could in itself handle the transaction volume of a global financial system.</p><p>The framing of “big blockers versus small blockers” is a conveniently polarized reduction of a much more granular reality. To believe that there is no subtlety between the two sides of this debate is to underestimate the number of dimensions to this argument. It’s an unfortunate side effect of rigidly programmed Twitter bots, and a political atmosphere in which your lines in the sand are demarcated by which subreddit you choose to affiliate with.</p><p>That said–my impression is that the more experienced engineers are overwhelmingly on the side of small blocks plus lightning network as the most promising approach to scaling Bitcoin. Take whatever side of the debate you want. A single line of Bitcoin core code speaks much louder than an avalanche of tweets.</p><p>In today’s episode, Jameson Lopp joins the show to explain why lightning network is an appealing engineering construct. We play the devil’s advocate and contrast lightning network with a big block approach, as well as a big block plus lightning network approach. Jameson also describes his experience working within the Ethereum ecosystem, and gives a sober explanation of some of the issues that Ethereum scalers may themselves encounter.</p>',

    'Episodes Pubdate Date': '2017-12-08',
    'Episodes Summary': '<p>The Internet was designed as a decentralized system. </p><p>Theoretically, if Alice wants to send an email to Bob, she can set up an email client on her computer and send that email to Bob’s email server on his computer. In reality, very few people run their own email servers. We all send our emails to centralized services like Gmail, and connect to those centralized services using our own client—a browser on our laptop or a mobile application on our smart phone.</p><p>Gmail is popular because nobody wants to run their own email server—it’s too much work. With Gmail, our emails our centralized, but centralization comes with convenience.</p><p>Similar centralization happened with online payments. </p><p>If Alice wants to send $5 to Bob, she needs to go through centralized banking infrastructure. Alice tells her bank to send $5 from her bank account to Bob’s bank account. This is not how it works in the physical world. if Alice wants to pay cash to Bob, she doesn’t have to go and meet him at a physical bank. She just takes out a $5 bill from her wallet and hands it to him. </p><p>The invention of Bitcoin proved that digital wallets and peer-to-peer payments are possible. But running your own wallet is like running your own email server. It is inconvenient, and so we trade decentralization for convenience once again. We use services like Coinbase, where users buy and sell cryptocurrencies in a centralized provider.</p><p>There are people in the cryptocurrency community who hate the idea of Coinbase. These people keep their cryptocurrency spread out on their own hardware wallets. Some of these people also run their own email servers.</p><p>Are these people just adding unnecessary inconvenience to their lives for no reason? No. These are smart, successful people. They don’t like to waste time. So what are they doing running their own email servers?</p><p>Distributed systems theory teaches the risk of centralized computer systems. If you have a single server that all your communication has to be routed through, your computer network will stop functioning if that server dies.</p><p>Today, civilization is reliant on centralized computer systems. This is fundamentally dangerous. The 2008 financial crisis proved how risky it is to centralize our money in the hands of a few people. The Equifax breach proved how risky it is to centralize our identity in the hands of a few people. </p><p>What happens if Dropbox runs out of money and has to shut down? What happens if all of the data centers at Amazon Web Services get wiped simultaneously? What happens if Coinbase gets hacked and every user at Coinbase loses all their money?</p><p>We have seen centralized systems collapse. The people who are running their own email servers are not crazy. Even if Gmail disappears tomorrow, they will still have access to their emails. With the example of email, we see that deploying and managing a decentralized system is possible. </p><p>Decentralization is a desirable feature of computer systems. So how do we make more of our applications decentralized?</p><p>The cypherpunks were working for decades to make decentralized money a reality. Satoshi Nakamoto invented the blockchain, and we now have a computer science construct that enables decentralized money. The blockchain also enables many other decentralized applications.</p><p>By solving a specific problem, Satoshi came up with a general solution. This is how progress often happens in computer science. In order to fix a system, we create a new tool. That tool can be applied to other systems that we don’t anticipate.</p><p>The blockchain is a tool that solves one set of problems in distributed systems. Conflict-free replicated data types are another type of tool. </p><p>Conflict-free replicated data types (or CRDTs for short) are objects that can be mutated by multiple users at the same time without creating data corruption. The most common example of a conflict-free replicated data type is the shopping cart. </p><p>Let’s say Alice and Bob share an account on an ecommerce web site. Alice is building a house, and she wants to buy some tools online. Alice has a shopping cart with a hammer in it. Bob logs into the ecommerce web site from a different computer at the same time Alice is logged in. Bob just wants to buy a tuxedo—he doesn’t know why Alice left a hammer in the shopping cart, so he clicks a button to remove all the items from the shopping cart. At the exact same moment, Alice clicks from her computer to add a drill to the shopping cart.</p><p>The server receives both requests: Bob wants to delete all items in the shopping cart, Alice wants to add a drill to the shopping cart. Both requests occurred at the exact same time, but we have to decide how to process them in some order. This is a situation known as a conflict. </p><p>Which request should execute first? Should the resulting shopping cart be empty? Should the shopping cart only have a drill in it? In either case, Alice or Bob is going to be disappointed—there is no way to avoid that. But we need some way to resolve the conflict deterministically. We do not want to have to send a message to both Alice and Bob that says “sorry, our shopping cart cannot handle your request. Please try again later.”</p><p>We need the shopping cart to be a conflict-free shopping cart—and today’s episode is about the different techniques that can be used for conflict resolution.</p><p>The shopping cart is a simple example where user collaboration leads to conflicts. Imagine all the other ways you collaborate with other users: chat systems like Slack, social networks like Facebook, document systems like Google Docs. </p><p>One way to resolve a conflict is through a technique called operational transform. Operational transform requires all the operations in the distributed system to be funneled through a centralized server. When a conflict occurs, the centralized server detects the problem and figures out how to resolve it.</p><p>Google Docs uses operational transform to resolve the frequent conflicts that occur when two users are sharing a text document. But operational transform only works if you have a centralized server.</p><p>An alternative solution is conflict-free replicated data types, which maintain each user’s replica of the data in a format that allows the client copies to resolve conflicts in a peer-to-peer fashion—without a centralized server. </p><p>Last example: Alice and Bob are now collaborating on a document that uses a CRDT data structure under the hood. Whenever they send their local changes to each other, any conflicts that occur can be resolved directly on the client. Alice and Bob can collaborate on a document just like they can send emails to each other. </p><p>With CRDTs, we can build decentralized, collaborative applications. But CRDTs are hard to use. Just like with blockchain technology, we don’t yet have the simple, elegant abstractions that let inexperienced programmers build peer-to-peer applications without the fear of conflicts.</p><p>Martin Kleppman is a distributed systems researcher and the author of <em>Data Intensive Applications</em>. Martin is concerned by the centralization of our computer networks, and he works on CRDT technology in order to make it easier for people to build peer-to-peer applications.</p><p>Most of the people who know how to build systems with CRDTs are distributed systems PhDs, database experts, and people working at huge internet companies. How do you make developer-friendly CRDTs? How do you allow random hackers to build peer-to-peer applications that avoid conflicts? Start by making a CRDT out of the most widely used, generalizable data structure in modern application development: the JSON object.</p><p>In today’s episode, Martin and I talk about conflict resolution, CRDTs, and decentralized applications. This is Martin’s second time on the show, and his first interview is the most popular episode to date.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Public key encryption allows for encrypted, private messages. A message sent from Bob to Alice gets encrypted using Alice’s public key. Public key encryption also allows for signed messages–so that when Alice signs a message, Alice uses her private key and Bob can verify it if Bob has her public key.</p><p>In both cases, Bob needs Alice’s public key! If Bob gets that public key from an email message, Bob is trusting that the email message is secure–and if Bob can’t ever verify that first message containing the key, he has no way to verify the messages that come after it.</p><p>This is the problem of key distribution.</p><p>Key distribution undermines the usability of PGP encryption. Serious encryption advocates will sometimes meet in person to exchange pieces of paper containing public keys. Keybase is a company that attempts to solve the problem of key distribution by having users connect social media accounts and devices to Keybase, in order to collectively verify who you are, and then give you the power to share your public key.</p><p>Max Krohn is a founder of Keybase, and was previously a founder of SparkNotes and OKCupid. Max was on the show a few years ago to discuss the basics of Keybase, and in this episode he explores some of the abstractions that Keybase has built on top of its core identity tool–Keybase File System, Keybase Teams, and Keybase Git.

When a contract is deployed, every full node on the Ethereum blockchain has a copy of the contract code in that node’s address space.</p><p>Every full node needs to hold a copy of every smart contract. This allows every full node to process every call to any smart contract. If you want to call a smart contract, that contract will execute on every full node. </p><p>When you call a smart contract, you are initiating a transaction.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Bitcoin is underappreciated even to this day. The public focus is usually on the speculative value, but Bitcoin has functional value as a technology platform. </p><p>If I want to make 100 transactions with my bank for 1 cent, the bank won’t allow it. Our current financial infrastructure is not set up for micropayments. Bitcoin is built with micropayments in mind. As Bitcoin works through its governance issues and its scalability problems, we will see gradual improvement in financial liquidity between people and machines.</p><p>21 is a company that has raised $120M to make Bitcoin useful to developers. This is a long term project, and the first step of that project is to get Bitcoin in the hands of users. To fulfill that end, 21 is developing services that encourage people to make small digital transactions.</p><p>The first service is the 21 messaging service, where users can pay to send messages to people who are unlikely to respond to an unsolicited email otherwise. For example, if I want to send an email to a venture capitalist pitching my company, I am more likely to get a response if I pay that venture capitalist $20 to read my message through 21, rather than if I sent a cold email from my email address.</p><p>Balaji Srinivasan is the CEO of 21, and he joins me for a conversation about the potential of Bitcoin and the objectives of the company he is building.</p><p>Software Engineering Daily is having our third Meetup, Wednesday May 3rd at Galvanize in San Francisco.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>On Software Engineering Daily, we have been covering the “serverless” movement in detail. For people who don’t use serverless functions, it seems like a niche. Serverless functions are stateless, auto-scaling, event driven blobs of code. You might say “serverless sounds kind of cool, but why don’t I just use a server? It’s a paradigm I’m used to.”</p><p>Serverless is exciting not because of what it adds but because of what it subtracts. The potential of serverless technology is to someday not have to worry about scalability at all.</p><p>Today, we take for granted that if you start a new company, you are building it on cloud infrastructure. The problem of maintaining server hardware disappeared for 99% of startups, which unlocked a wealth of innovation.</p><p>The cloud also simplified scalability for most startups–but there are still plenty of companies that struggle to scale. Significant mental energy is spent on the following questions: How many database replicas do I need? How do I configure my load balancer? How many nodes should I put in my Kafka cluster?</p><p>Serverless functions are important because they are an auto-scaling component that sits at a low level. This makes it easy to build auto scaling systems on top of them. Auto scaling databases, queueing systems, machine learning tools, and user applications. </p><p>And since the problem is being solved at such a low level, the pricing competitions will also take place at the low level, meaning that systems built on serverless functions will probably see steep declines in costs in the coming years. Serverless compute could eventually become free or nearly free, with the major cloud providers using it as a loss leader to onboard developers to higher level services.</p><p>All of this makes for an exciting topic of discussion, that we will be repeatedly covering. Today’s show is with Eduardo Laureano, the principal program manager of Azure Functions. It was a fantastic conversation and we covered applications of serverless, improvements to the “cold start problem,” and how the Azure Functions platform is built and operated. Full disclosure: Microsoft is a sponsor of Software Engineering Daily.</p><p>Meetups for Software Engineering Daily are being planned! Go to softwareengineeringdaily.com/meetup if you want to register for an upcoming Meetup. In March, I’ll be visiting Datadog in New York and Hubspot in Boston, and in April I’ll be at Telesign in LA.</p><p>Summer internship applications to Software Engineering Daily are also being accepted.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>David Cancel has started five companies, most recently Drift. Drift is a conversational marketing and sales platform. David has a depth of engineering skills and a breadth of business experience that make him an amazing source of knowledge. In today’s episode, David discusses topics ranging from the technical details of making a machine learning-driven sales platform to the battle scars from his early career, when he spent a lot of time building products that people did not want. He has found success by focusing on building software that the market has shown a desire for.</p><p>Chatbots were a popular, trendy subject a few years ago. The success of chatbots manifested in them fading into the background, and becoming a subtle, increasing part of our everyday interactions. Not every online interaction can be replaced by a chatbot, but many online interactions can be made more efficient by using chatbots. Chatbots can serve well-defined information, like product features, or the hours of operation of a business. When a chatbot gets a question that it cannot answer, the bot can route the conversation to a human.</p><p>When a customer lands on a web page of a company using Drift, they see a chat box appear in the corner of the screen. The customer is able to communicate through that chat box with a bot that represents the company. The customer can learn about the product, schedule a call with a salesperson, and get other useful utilities from the Drift sales bot.</p><p>The Drift chatbot messaging system is handled by Elixir/Erlang. Erlang is widely known as the messaging language that was used to scale WhatsApp while maintaining high availability. On the backend, Java services take the interactions from the Driftbot and pull it into a CRM, which allows sales and marketing people to manage information about the customers that are interacting with the chatbot. David gives lots more detail around the engineering stack, the deployment model, and his thoughts on the business and modern engineering.</p><p>We recently launched a new podcast: Fintech Daily! Fintech Daily is about payments, cryptocurrencies, trading, and the intersection between finance and technology. You can find it on fintechdaily.co or Apple and Google podcasts. We are looking for other hosts who want to participate. If you are interested in becoming a host, send us an email: host@fintechdaily.co</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>The Berkeley AMPLab was a research lab where <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/02/26/spark-and-streaming-with-matei-zaharia/">Apache Spark</a> and <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/05/11/cluster-schedulers-with-ben-hindman/">Apache Mesos</a> were both created. In the last five years, the Mesos and Spark projects have changed the way infrastructure is managed and improved the tools for data science.</p><p>Because of its proximity to Silicon Valley, Berkeley has become a university where fundamental research is blended with a sense of industry applications. <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/11/07/computer-architecture-with-dave-patterson/">Students and professors move between business and academia</a>, finding problems in industry and bringing them into the lab where they can be studied without the day-to-day pressures of a corporation.</p><p>This makes Berkeley the perfect place for research around “<a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/?s=serverless">serverless</a>”.</p><p>Serverless computing abstracts away the notion of a server, allowing developers to work at a higher level and be less concerned about the problems inherent in servers–such as failing instances and unpredictable network connections. </p><p>With serverless functions-as-a-service, the cloud provider makes guarantees around the execution of serverless code–such as with <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2017/12/07/serverless-applications-with-randall-hunt/">AWS Lambda</a>. With serverless backend services, the cloud provider makes guarantees around the reliability of a database or queueing system.</p><p>The cloud provider is operating servers to power this functionality. But the user is not exposed to those servers.</p><p>Today’s show centers around the serverless functions-as-a-service. This is a new paradigm of computing, and there are many open questions. <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2017/12/04/serverless-scheduling-with-rodric-rabbah/">How can the servers for our functions be quickly provisioned?</a> <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/10/19/aws-containers-with-deepak-singh/">How can we parallelize batch jobs into functions as a service?</a> How can large numbers of serverless functions communicate with each other reliably to coordinate?</p><p>In production applications, <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2017/11/14/serverless-event-driven-architecture-with-danilo-poccia/">functions-as-a-service are mostly used for “event-driven” applications</a>. But the potential for functions-as-a-service is much larger. </p><p>Ion Stoica is a professor of computer science at Berkeley, where he leads the RISELab. He is the co-founder of Conviva Networks and Databricks. Databricks is the company that was born as a result of the research on Apache Spark. Ion now serves as executive chairman of Databricks. Ion joins the show to describe why serverless computing is exciting, the open research problems, and the solutions that researchers at the RISELab are exploring.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Tim O’Reilly’s book <em>What’s the Future?</em> is an overview of business, technology, and society. As the founder of O’Reilly Media, Tim has been steeped in technology trends for the last 40 years. From his vantage point running conferences and publishing technical content, Tim has been able to make informed predictions about what is coming next.</p><p>In today’s conversation, Tim gave his perspective on how artificial intelligence will impact our world in the coming decades. More importantly–Tim emphasizes the role of human agency. The future is not something that merely happens to us as we sit back and eat popcorn. Today, we make decisions, and those decisions that we make could help lead us to technology utopia or towards the fall of our great technological empire.</p><p>On the subject of business, Tim gave a radically different perspective than most of the entrepreneurs that come on Software Engineering Daily. In our conversation, he raised the question of why entrepreneurs raise massive amounts of money, get on the treadmill of startup hype, and build a company around negative cash flows. For that model, the only possible outcomes are going public, being acquired, or flaming out completely. O’Reilly Media has been cash flow positive since the beginning, and the company has steadily compounded, growing successively bigger businesses from publishing to conferences to online learning.</p><p>This episode gave me a lot to think about–just as the O’Reilly Conferences have throughout the years. O’Reilly Media has graciously partnered with SE Daily since we were very small, so I have great admiration for the company and Tim himself. It was a pleasure to get the chance to meet him in person.</p><p>Transcript provided by We Edit Podcasts.

Parse was a newer kind of cloud provider called “backend-as-a-service”, built to simplify the complexities of Amazon Web Services and the complexities of the mobile ecosystem. </p><p>During this time, Facebook was in the middle of its shift toward becoming a mobile application company. Ads on the smartphone were not yet a proven business model. Facebook was exploring other business lines, and decided to purchase Parse for $85 million, with the intention of building a cloud developer platform.</p><p>Shortly after the acquisition, Facebook’s mobile ads business started to see considerable success. With the mobile ads business finding traction, Facebook shifted all available resources towards supporting that business model. In 2017, Parse was shut down.</p><p>Ilya joins the show to give his experience starting Parse, selling the company to Facebook, and then seeing the company he had built get shut down as it became an unfortunate casualty of Facebook’s advertising success. We talked a lot about the experience of building a backend-as-a-service company, as well as what makes Facebook special as an organization, and how the success of Facebook’s mobile business happened to coincide with the Parse acquisition.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Building software today is much faster than it was just a few years ago. The tools are higher level, and abstract away tasks that would have required months of development. Much of a developer’s time used to be spent optimizing databases, load balancers, and queueing systems in order to be able to handle the load created by thousands of users. Today, scalability is built into much of our infrastructure by default.</p><p>We have had several years of infrastructure with automatic scalability, and some of the more recent advances in developer tooling are about convenience, and faster development time. Developers are spending less time dealing with the ambiguous idea of a “server” and more time interacting with well-defined APIs and data sources.</p><p>A few examples are AppSync from Amazon Web Services and Firebase from Google. These tools are like databases with rich interactive functionality. Instead of having to create a server to listen to a database for changes and push notifications to users in response to those changes, AppSync and Firebase can be programmed to have this kind of functionality built in.</p><p>There are many other examples of high level APIs, rich backends, and developer productivity tools that lead to shorter development time. What does this mean for developers? It means we can build much faster. We can prototype quickly for low amounts of money–without sacrificing quality. We can spend more time focusing on design, user experience, and business models and less time focusing on keeping the application up and running.</p><p>Nader Dabit is a developer advocate at Amazon Web Services, and he returns to the show to discuss modern tooling, and how that tooling changes the potential for high output and fast iteration among developers. It is a strategic, philosophical discussion of how to build modern software.</p>',

Whether you use Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, or Safari, your browser interprets and executes code in a virtual machine–and that virtual machine only runs JavaScript. Unfortunately, JavaScript is not ideal for every task we want to perform in the browser. </p><p>Think about the use cases where you need to use software outside of the browser: video editing, music production, 3D art, video games. These applications require a high degree of performance that is hard to get from raw JavaScript.</p><p>WebAssembly was created to get better performance on the web. WebAssembly allows code from other languages to be compiled and run in the browser. With WebAssembly, languages such as C, C++, and Rust can be used to achieve major performance gains. WebAssembly is still under development, and eventually more programming languages will be accessible as well. </p><p>Lin Clark is an engineer on the Mozilla Developer Relations team, and has been working closely on the WebAssembly project. She is the author of a <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/02/a-cartoon-intro-to-webassembly/">detailed series of illustrated blog posts that explain how WebAssembly works</a>. In this episode, we discuss how WebAssembly came to be, its advantages over a web driven purely by Javascript, what is possible with WebAssembly, and its engineering implementation. </p>',

Why would it be good for the government to regulate prices on the data that passes around wires owned by a corporation? The problem is that a large portion of the United States can only be served by wires owned by a single company. In those instances, the company that owns the wires has monopoly pricing power over the data delivered to homes in those geographic regions.</p><p>Quincy Larson is the founder of Free Code Camp and a frequent author of internet-based articles on Medium. He returns to Software Engineering Daily to make the case for Net Neutrality. I was convinced by some of his arguments and less convinced by others.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p><em>Originally published June 13, 2019. We are taking a few weeks off. We’ll be back soon with new episodes.</em></p><p>Machine learning allows software to improve as that software consumes more data. </p><p>Machine learning is a tool that every software engineer wants to be able to use. Because machine learning is so broadly applicable, software companies want to make the tools more accessible to the developers across the organization.</p><p>There are many steps that an engineer must go through to use machine learning, and each additional step inhibits the chances that the engineer will actually get their model into production.</p><p>An engineer who wants to build machine learning into their application needs access to data sets. They need to join those data sets, and load them into a machine (or multiple machines) where their model can be trained. Once the model is trained, the model needs to test on additional data to ensure quality. If the initial model quality is insufficient, the engineer might need to tweak the training parameters. </p><p>Once a model is accurate enough, the engineer needs to deploy that model. After deployment, the model might need to be updated with new data later on. If the model is processing sensitive or financially relevant data, a provenance process might be necessary to allow for an audit trail of decisions that have been made by the model.</p><p>Rob Story and Kelley Rivoire are engineers working on machine learning infrastructure at Stripe. After recognizing the difficulties that engineers faced in creating and deploying machine learning models, Stripe engineers built out Railyard, an API for machine learning workloads within the company.</p><p>Rob and Kelley join the show to discuss data engineering and machine learning at Stripe, and their work on Railyard.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Investing is an infinite game. </p><p>In a game, a player can formulate a strategy based on the available resources, the apparent variance of the environment, and the metagame of the other actors involved. For an investor, the game board includes companies, currencies, and people. </p><p>A successful game player can model their actions mathematically. They can describe a thesis for an in-game decision with clear language. Game players who reason through “gut feeling” do not perform well (unless their “gut” is aligned with correct mathematical heuristics). The same is true for investors. An investor who is going to be successful in the long term will be able to explain their investment thesis crisply.</p><p>Each investment represents a bet with net positive expected value. The expected value of an investment is the sum of all potential probability-weighted future outcomes of a business. Each of those potential expected outcomes is the anticipated outcome times the probability that the investment works out in the anticipated way.</p><p>Brian Singerman is a computer scientist and partner at Founder’s Fund. He is on the board of Affirm, AltSchool, Emerald Therapeutics, and a variety of other companies in disparate areas. He also plays lots of board games. Brian was a lot of fun to talk to because he was willing to field questions from an expansive range of topics–and he answered them so quickly and concisely that I started to get nervous that I was going to run out of things to ask him.</p><p>Many of the businesses Brian has invested in do not have a well-defined historical precedent. If a venture capital investor was trying to make bets in defined “sectors” that investor would probably overlook a business like Forward (a vertically integrated healthcare company) or Cloud9 (a collection of esports teams).</p><p>If an investment does not have a historical precedent, it’s harder to reason about it by analogy. You have to judge it by fundamental reasoning: the current market, the capability of the founders, and the economics of the business model.</p><p>In many professions, reasoning by analogy will work out perfectly fine. You can pattern match on the past, and use that to justify decisions for the future. But if your professional livelihood depends on reasoning by fundamental principles, you get trained to assess situations that do not have precedent.</p><p>Transcript provided by We Edit Podcasts.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>A service mesh is an abstraction that provides traffic routing, policy management, and telemetry for a distributed application. </p><p>A service mesh consists of a data plane and a control plane. In the data plane, a proxy runs alongside each service, with every request from a service being routed through the proxy. In the control plane, an application owner can control the behavior of the proxies distributed throughout the application.</p><p>As the Kubernetes ecosystem has developed, the service mesh abstraction has become an increasingly desirable component of a “cloud native” application stack. </p><p>As companies enthusiastically adopt Kubernetes, they eventually find themselves with a large distributed system that is difficult to operate. A service mesh simplifies some of these operational difficulties, <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/?s=service+mesh">as we have explored in numerous previous episodes.</a></p><p>The Kubernetes community has grown to include lots of enterprises, and those enterprises want to adopt service mesh. But today, many of them are afraid to adopt the technology because there are multiple competing products, and it is unclear which one the community will centralize around–or if the community will end up supporting multiple products.</p><p>Over the next few weeks, we will be airing interviews from KubeCon EU 2019 in Barcelona. These interviews are a window into the world of the Kubernetes and the cloud-native ecosystem, which is transforming the world of infrastructure software.</p><p>The most prominent theme across these shows was that of service mesh. Why was service mesh such an important topic? Because the battle for service mesh supremacy is a classic technology competition between a giant incumbent and a startup with far fewer resources.</p><p>The Kubernetes ecosystem is beautifully engineered to allow for a marketplace of warring ideas where the most worthy competitor wins out–but in some cases there is room for multiple products to occupy different subsections of the market.</p><p>Across these episodes, one theme we will explore is the governance and the diplomacy of these competing solutions, and how the Kubernetes ecosystem is structured to allow for harmonious resolution to technology battles.</p><p>It is tempting to look at this competition between service meshes as winner-take-all. But as of late May 2019, we do not yet know if it will be winner-take-all. In order to predict how the service mesh wars will play out, the best we can do is to look at historical examples.</p><p>Container orchestration wars was a winner-take-all market. Container orchestration was a problem of such depth, such technical complexity and integration, that there had to be a single winner for the ecosystem to marshall around. </p><p>During the container orchestration wars, as Mesos and Docker Swarm and HashiCorp Nomad and Kubernetes fought for supremacy, many large enterprises made bets on container orchestration systems that were not Kubernetes. When the dust settled, Kubernetes was the victor, and these large enterprises who had adopted orchestration systems other than Kubernetes begrudgingly began thinking about how to migrate to Kubernetes.</p><p>But during the orchestration wars, many more enterprises were sitting out altogether. They did not choose Kubernetes or Mesos or Swarm. They chose to wait.</p><p>Enterprise technologists are smart, and they can tell when a technology is immature. Although many enterprises wanted an orchestration system to manage their Docker containers, they did not want to insert a heavy abstraction that they would have to tear out later on. </p><p>Once Kubernetes won the orchestration wars, enterprise dollars piled into the space. The cloud native community has grown faster than anyone expected, because we solved the collective action problem of centralizing on a container orchestrator.</p><p>From enterprises to cloud providers to ISVs to podcasters, we share the same vision for Kubernetes: it is the Linux for distributed systems.</p><p>Within the Kubernetes ecosystem, the thought leadership tries not to pick winners. It is better for everyone if the winners are decided through competition. In order to foster competition, interfaces into Kubernetes can provide a layer of standardization along which different products can compete. Enterprises can buy into an interface without buying into any particular product.</p><p>Examples include the container networking interface (CNI) and the container storage interface (CSI). Every Kubernetes application wants storage and networking, but these Kubernetes applications do not want to be locked into a particular provider. Since there is a standardized interface for networking and storage, these applications can swap out one storage provider for another, or one networking provider for another.</p><p>How does this relate to service mesh?</p><p>In the service mesh market, Buoyant was first to market with its open source project Linkerd. Today’s guest William Morgan is the CEO of Buoyant. Over the last four years, Linkerd has slowly grown a following of dedicated users who run the open source service mesh in production. </p><p>Over the last four years, Linkerd has changed from its initial technology of the embedded JVM service proxy developed at Twitter to a Rust-based sidecar data plane and a Go-based control plane. Buoyant’s dedicated focus to the service mesh space has won over much of the community, as was evidenced by Linkerd becoming the predominant apparel brand at Kubecon EU 2019: Linkerd hats and t-shirts were everywhere at the conference.</p><p>Why did Linkerd become trendy? Ironically, because of a competing service mesh whose launch strategy was widely seen as an affront to the spirit of the cloud native community.</p><p>Istio was created within Google, and launched with a set of brittle partnerships with IBM and other companies. Istio careened into the Kubernetes ecosystem with violent fanfare, trumpeting itself as the cloud native service mesh du jour through endless banner ads, marketing email campaigns, and KubeCon programming.</p><p>Any listener to this podcast knows I am as gullible as any technologist. I’m an idealist–and I wanted to believe that Istio represented the service mesh equivalent of Kubernetes. It’s from Google, it launched with a bunch of impressive logos, and it has an inspiring vision. Looks cloud native, smells cloud native, must be cloud native, right?</p><p>Unfortunately, Istio’s early marketing aggrandizements were disconnected from the nascent realities of the project. Istio was buggy and difficult to set up. Istio quickly developed a reputation as Google-manufactured vaporware: nice idea, not nearly ready for production.</p><p>For Linkerd, the timing could not have been better.</p><p>Istio’s romantic vision of an operating plane for routing traffic, managing security policy, and measuring network telemetry had seduced the enterprise masses. With their cravings unmet by Istio, these enterprises surveyed the market and quickly found their way to Linkerd, the humble service mesh next door, who had been waiting patiently all along.</p><p>The tide has turned against Istio, and towards Linkerd. But the service mesh wars have just begun. And as easy as it is to criticize Istio, the project is not only vaporware. Istio has a vision for a detailed operating plane that will evolve together with Envoy, a service proxy sidecar developed at Lyft. </p><p>Perhaps Istio’s early embers had too much marketing gasoline poured on them initially, but the project could still succeed. Google is the most sophisticated, well-resourced company in the world–and judging from Google’s adjacent strategic messaging around Anthos and other strategic initiatives, the company has already decided that Istio will be around for the long haul. </p><p>As a community, we should be grateful to witness the folly of Istio’s carpet-bomb marketing strategy. It is validation for the earnest resilience of the cloud native community, that even under the omnipresent duress of Google marketing, the community was able to collectively reject the Istio Kool Aid.</p><p>This should come as no surprise. The Cloud Native Computing Foundation resides within the Linux Foundation, and the Kubernetes ecosystem has been ordained with the ardent technical purity of Linus Torvalds. </p><p>The CNCF was formed under the looming shadow of AWS. The CNCF was seeded with the donation of Kubernetes by Google. Much like the Linux community was positioned as a rebellious movement in reaction to Microsoft’s dominance, the Kubernetes community represents a fervent desire to open up the market to cloud providers beyond the tight-lipped, proprietary dominion of Amazon.</p><p>With such a deep spirit of insubordination, it is no surprise that the community has rejected Istio like a set of loosely coupled organs rejecting a foreign skin attempting to layer itself across them. Even though the CNCF was founded by Google, the community was formed in spite of big centralized clouds, not as a marketing vessel for their products which may or may not be open source. </p><p>Microsoft seems to understand this fact better than Google, at least in the domain of service mesh.</p><p>The day after this interview with William, Microsoft announced the Service Mesh Interface (SMI), a project it partnered with Buoyant and other companies on to create a minimal spec for what a service mesh should offer to a Kubernetes deployment. The SMI presents a safe buy-in point for enterprises who want a service mesh, but do not want to get caught in the evangelistic crossfire of Istio and Linkerd.</p><p>It is in this environment that we begin our next series of shows on the current cloud native ecosystem.</p><p>Thanks to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation for putting together an amazing podcasting zone at KubeCon, and allowing me to conduct these interviews.</p><p>We are hiring two interns for software engineering and business development!

But a series of numbers is a representation that we can all agree on, whether we are a computer or a human.</p><p>In recent shows, we have explored how to train machine learning models to understand images and video. Today, we explore words. You might be thinking–”isn’t a word easy to understand? Can’t you just take the dictionary definition?” A dictionary definition does not capture the richness of a word. Dictionaries do not give you a way to measure similarity between one word and all other words in a given language.</p><p>Word2vec is a system for defining words in terms of the words that appear close to that word. For example, the sentence “Howard is sitting in a Starbucks cafe drinking a cup of coffee” gives an obvious indication that the words “cafe,” “cup,” and “coffee” are all related. With enough sentences like that, we can start to understand the entire language.</p><p>Adrian Colyer is a venture capitalist with Accel, and blogs about technical topics <a href="https://blog.acolyer.org/2016/04/21/the-amazing-power-of-word-vectors/">such as word2vec</a>. We talked about word2vec specifically, and the deep learning space more generally. We also explored how the rapidly improving tools around deep learning are changing the venture investment landscape.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Edge computing allows for faster data access and computation. </p><p>When your client application makes a request, that request might be routed to the edge. Edge servers are more numerous and more widely distributed than normal data centers, but an edge server might not have all of the data or the complete application logic for the backend to serve your request.</p><p>Edge servers have historically been used for content delivery networks (CDN). CDNs are useful for hosting and serving media files that might otherwise be slow to access over a network. More recently, applications are also using edge servers for computation, as well as storage of resources which are smaller than the movies, music, and images that have traditionally been stored on an edge server.</p><p>Steve Klabnik is an engineer with Cloudflare, and he returns to the show to discuss storage at the edge. In Steve’s previous appearances we have explored Rust and WebAssembly, and we also touch on those topics in today’s episode.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Machine learning allows software to improve as that software consumes more data. </p><p>Machine learning is a tool that every software engineer wants to be able to use. Because machine learning is so broadly applicable, software companies want to make the tools more accessible to the developers across the organization.</p><p>There are many steps that an engineer must go through to use machine learning, and each additional step inhibits the chances that the engineer will actually get their model into production.</p><p>An engineer who wants to build machine learning into their application needs access to data sets. They need to join those data sets, and load them into a machine (or multiple machines) where their model can be trained. Once the model is trained, the model needs to test on additional data to ensure quality. If the initial model quality is insufficient, the engineer might need to tweak the training parameters. </p><p>Once a model is accurate enough, the engineer needs to deploy that model. After deployment, the model might need to be updated with new data later on. If the model is processing sensitive or financially relevant data, a provenance process might be necessary to allow for an audit trail of decisions that have been made by the model.</p><p>Rob Story and Kelley Rivoire are engineers working on machine learning infrastructure at Stripe.

Many companies are bottlenecked by a shortage of data scientists who can query that data effectively. This results in an organizational dysfunction where people lining up to ask questions of the data science team are unable to move as fast as they want to.</p><p>Tomasz Tunguz saw this when he was working at Google, and he continues to see it today from his position at Redpoint, where he works as a venture capitalist looking at companies. The problems with the “data supply chain” led him to write “Winning With Data”, a book about how technology companies can successfully operationalize, explore, and act on their data.</p><p>We’ve done many shows about the interactions between software engineers, data engineers, and data scientists.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Technology is pushing us rapidly toward a future that is impossible to forecast. We try to imagine what that future might look like, and we can’t help having our predictions shaped by the media we have consumed.</p><p>1984, Terminator, Gattaca, Ex Machina, Black Mirror–all of these stories present a dystopian future. But if you look around the world, the most successful technologists are mostly guided by a sense of optimism. Technologists themselves are mostly idealistic–they see the future through a utopian lens. Popular media largely tells a different story: that we are headed for a dystopian world.</p><p>Why is there such a gulf in the level of idealism between technologists and the media? </p><p>Mike Solana found himself asking that question on a regular basis during his work at Founder’s Fund, where he is a vice president. Founder’s Fund has a bias toward funding difficult, cutting-edge technology like gene editing, robotics, and nuclear energy. This technology that Mike was seeing made him excited about the future–which led to his creation of the podcast “Anatomy of Next.”</p><p>“Anatomy of Next” has explored biology, robotics, nuclear energy, superintelligence, and the nature of reality. Soon the podcast will be exploring how our civilization will explore and settle the solar system–specifically Mars. </p><p>I’ve listened through the entire first season of the show twice and enjoyed it so much because Mike explores questions that are on the border of philosophy and technology–questions about the nature of reality, and what makes us human–and nobody can give perfect answers to these questions. But Mike interviews top experts on the show, which provides us with a framework. Guests on “Anatomy of Next” include Nick Bostrom (the author of Superintelligence), George Church (a pioneer in gene editing), and Palmer Luckey (the founder of VR company Oculus).</p><p>Mike joins the show to talk about why he started “Anatomy of Next,” and his own perspective on the future.</p><p>Transcript provided by We Edit Podcasts.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Front is a shared inbox application that has seen rapid adoption within companies. Front allows multiple members of a company to collaborate together on a conversation–whether that conversation is in email, Twitter, or Facebook Messenger. This is useful when a customer email needs to be shared between the sales and engineering teams, or when a single email address is shared between different members of the same team, such as “contact@softwareengineeringdaily.com”.</p><p>This might sound like a niche problem, but it is actually a problem faced somewhere within every single company. Because the problem of shared inbox is so prevalent, the company has grown its user base quickly, scaling the team as well as the infrastructure.</p><p>The sensitivity of the data (emails) that Front is handling means that security is paramount. And as users of Front rely on it more and more as a central point of communication, uptime and consistency needs to be maintained.</p><p>Laurent Perrin is the CTO at Front, and he joins the show to describe the software architecture and product strategy for Front. It was a fascinating show, and we covered the full stack. On the backend, Front pulls emails into S3 buckets and maintains the schema of the inbox in a SQL database. The desktop Front client is written in Electron, which is a way to write desktop applications in HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS.</p><p>We also talked about the system for keeping the communications “real-time”–it’s important that users are aware of what each other is doing, since you don’t want to be preparing a response to an email at the same time I am.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>For a decade, Bitcoin’s proof-of-work system has run without disruption. In a proof-of-work scheme, Bitcoin miners compete to solve a cryptographic puzzle associated with a block of transactions. </p><p>Every ten minutes, all the Bitcoin miner nodes race to be the first to solve a block of transactions. Only one miner wins each block, meaning the other nodes’ time was ultimately wasted. There is also a massive expense of electricity.</p><p>Bitcoin is a system with low transaction throughput—about 7 transactions per second. Computer scientists have wondered—is there an alternative way of doing consensus? What if we took all the wasted compute power from proof of work, and allocated it in a way that makes transactions get processed faster?</p><p>But Bitcoin’s governance tends to be extremely conservative. A change to the consensus mechanism probably won’t happen any time soon in Bitcoin.</p><p>Ethereum’s consensus mechanism is modeled after that of Bitcoin—proof-of-work mining. But Ethereum’s governance ethos is quite different. Ethereum is in the process of planning and implementing proof of stake, an alternative consensus mechanism in which trusted validators are chosen to validate blocks of transactions. </p><p>Subhan Nadeem is a student at the University of Waterloo where he studies computer science and business. He is the author of several popular articles on Medium that explain blockchain concepts. He joins the show to talk about crypto from the point of a student—and gives us a great walk through of different consensus mechanisms.</p><p>To find all of our old episodes about cryptocurrencies, check out our apps in the  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/software-engineering-daily/id1253734426?mt=8">iOS</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.koalatea.thehollidayinn.softwareengineeringdaily&amp;hl=en">Android</a> app store.

Predicting the future in order to invest in companies in this space has the same level of complexity. </p><p>The cost of cloud computing is going down but the volume of total required space and processing power is going up. The open source community is growing and improving but people are increasingly willing to buy software that will save them time.</p><p>Capital is flowing into Silicon Valley at a faster rate than can be sensibly absorbed by the number of quality companies. A decent product won’t have trouble raising money. But a decent investor has to choose wisely among the huge selection of available opportunities.</p><p>Lenny Pruss works at Amplify Partners where he is currently focused on the cloud native space.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Online labor marketplaces are widely used for one-to-one transactions. On Uber, a rider hires a driver for transportation. On TaskRabbit, a homeowner hires a cleaner to come clean their kitchen.</p><p>These types of marketplaces are not as widely used for one-to-many transactions, but they can be just as useful. A warehouse owner would want to hire a group of workers to help with holiday shipments. A conference organizer would want to hire a group of event staffers to help run the conference.</p><p>Wonolo is an on-demand staffing platform. Businesses post jobs and workers apply for those jobs. The types of work include event staffing, warehouse operations, merchandising, and other general labor tasks. In past shows, we have covered on-demand work platforms such as Fiverr, Thumbtack, Uber, and Instacart. Wonolo presents another variation in the business model and software architecture of the gig economy.</p><p>Jeremy Burton is the CTO and chief data scientist at Wonolo. He joins the show to talk about building and scaling Wonolo, and some of the key strategic decisions that Wonolo has made along the way. As with any successful marketplace business, Wonolo has solved the chicken and egg problem of how to get supply and demand on the platform simultaneously. The company has grown deliberately, setting up operations in one city at a time to make sure that they can provide a good experience in both sides of the market in each of the new geographies.</p><p>Jeremy and I also talked about the broader effects that the gig economy could potentially have on the labor market. Gig economy platforms use a 5-star rating system and written reviews to judge workers, instead of a resume system. The gig economy allows for rapid job liquidity, and the potential for workers to steadily “level up” more quickly than they might be able to in a typical corporate job. These aspects of the gig economy are rarely discussed, so it was enlightening to hear Jeremy’s views on them.</p>',

Since being released in 2014, Swift has become one of the most popular languages due to its high performance and developer ergonomics. In 2015, Swift was open sourced, creating the opportunity for Swift to be used outside of the Apple ecosystem.</p><p>If you write an iPhone app today, your frontend is in Swift and your backend is probably in NodeJS, Java, or Ruby. Engineers are working to port Swift to the server so that the Swift developer experience is isomorphic: the same language on the backend and the frontend.</p><p>Chris Bailey is an engineer at IBM working on Kitura, a Swift web framework. In this episode, we discuss the history of Swift, why it is so appealing to developers, and why Swift could become a server side language with as much popularity as Java.</p><p>Software Engineering Daily is having our third Meetup, Wednesday May 3rd at Galvanize in San Francisco.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Tinder is a popular dating app where each user swipes through a sequence of other users in order to find a match. Swiping left means you are not interested. Swiping right means you would like to connect with the person. The simple premise of Tinder has led to massive growth, and the app is now also used to discover new friends and create casual meetings.</p><p>Every social network knows–if you are not growing, then you are dying. Growth is so important to Tinder, they have a large engineering organization devoted to five facets of growth: new users, activation, retention, dropoff, and anti-spam. </p><p>These five segments cover the entire Tinder user lifecycle, and there is a sub-team in charge of each of the five areas. No matter what kind of Tinder user you are, there are growth engineers focused on your experience.</p><p>Alex Ross is the director of engineering for the growth team at Tinder. His job requires a mix of data science, data engineering, psychology, and setting proper KPIs (key performance indicators). Each subteam has KPIs that determine how well they are doing with growth–and if the wrong KPI is set, it can create bad incentives. For example, a growth team that is focused only on getting users to spend more time engaging with Tinder would have an incentive to create so-called “dark patterns” that trigger addiction.</p>',

The startup has to hire tens of new employees. This requires raising capital, so the startup has to meet with investors and lawyers. A rapid influx of new customers puts a strain on the engineering and customer service elements of the company.</p><p>There is too much to do, and there is only so much time in a day.</p><p>The CEO of the high-growth company is up late into the night, answering emails and losing sleep. But these are good problems to have, and the company is in a state of exuberance. The CEO must balance psychological health with the stressful task of scaling a company.</p><p>Elad Gil is an entrepreneur and author of “High Growth Handbook”, a book of lessons and guidelines about how to navigate a startup that has found product market fit, and is beginning to scale.

In his book, <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Internet-Happened-Netscape-iPhone/dp/1631493078">How The Internet Happened: From Netscape to the iPhone</a></em>, Brian McCullough tells the story of the last 25 years of Internet development through the lens of companies like ebay, Amazon, Google, and Apple. </p><p>Whereas other books have focused on the trajectory of these individual companies, Brian explains how innovations in one company often lead to success in another. Without the lessons from Napster, we might not have Spotify. Without the trust model pioneered by ebay, we would not have marketplaces like Airbnb.</p><p>Brian is also the host of The Internet History Podcast and the Techmeme Ride Home podcast. In The Internet History Podcast, Brian interviews entrepreneurs and engineers who were firsthand witnesses to the developments that led to our modern Internet, including early employees at Amazon, Tesla, and TheGlobe.com. In his other podcast, the Techmeme Ride Home, Brian gives a daily overview of the day’s Internet news.</p><p>Through his podcasts about the Internet’s past and present, Brian has also accumulated an intuition about the future. He joins the show to discuss his book, the art of podcasting, and the historical lessons of technology.</p>',

These systems provide value for the end user by delivering information, virtual objects, and physical products as outputs. Another fundamental resource that is becoming easier to consume as input is money. There are also new outputs–financial constructs that are made possible by cloud computing, machine learning, and cryptocurrencies.</p><p>This is why so much opportunity exists in fintech. Money has always been a flexible tool for brokerage between humans. But as recently as the early 2000s, the interfaces between money and computers have been clunky and inflexible. Engineers that wanted to build financial systems around money had to work directly with banks and credit card processors.</p><p>More recently, there has been an explosion in new APIs and completely new financial primitives like cryptocurrencies. In the year 2000, a well-funded team had to struggle to put together a basic ecommerce company. Today, a blue ocean of opportunity has opened up for entrepreneurs building businesses around lending, insurance, underwriting, banking, and every other microcosm of the financial system.</p><p>Michael Walsh is a general partner and co-founder of Green Visor Capital.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Dogecoin was started in 2013 as a joke. Jackson Palmer forked Bitcoin and created his cryptocurrency as a play off the “doge” meme. The currency became popular as a means of reddit users “tipping” each other. If I made a comment on reddit that you liked, you might send me some Dogecoin. This use case allowed people to share the idea of Dogecoin virally, and Dogecoin became valuable, even though the currency did not have any technical properties that made it significantly different than Bitcoin.</p><p>As Dogecoin was becoming popular, an experienced Internet scam artist took notice and started a <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/dark-days-dogecoin-scammers-bandits-brought-cryptos-friendliest-currency/">Dogecoin exchange called Moolah</a>. Moolah was used to steal money from its customers and investors, and the CEO was arrested. </p><p>Jackson Palmer was not involved in this scheme, but it soured his feelings about Dogecoin and the entire Bitcoin space. His coin, which had been created as a joke, had been repurposed as a weapon to steal money.</p><p>Jackson left the Dogecoin community in 2015 to focus on other things. But as Bitcoin entered the mainstream conversation, Jackson has been pulled back into the world of cryptocurrency. Jackson’s YouTube channel has over 20,000 subscribers, who tune into learn about consensus protocols, new tokens, and cryptocurrency news.</p><p>In today’s episode, Jackson and I discuss his experiences with Dogecoin, and how that compares with the scams around low-quality ICOs that are pulling in retail investors today. We also discuss more positive things–such as proof-of-stake and newer consensus protocols.</p><p>If you are looking for an internship, apply to the Software Engineering Daily internship, at <a href="https://softwaredaily.com/jobs">softwaredaily.com/jobs</a>. And if you are looking to recruit engineers, you can post jobs for your company there as well–it’s completely free to post jobs and to apply.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Humans have now been defeated by computers at heads up no-limit holdem poker. </p><p>Some people thought this wouldn’t be possible. Sure, we can teach a computer to beat a human at Go or Chess. Those games have a smaller decision space. There is no hidden information. There is no bluffing. Poker must be different! It is too human to be automated.</p><p>The game space of poker is different than that of Go. It has 10^160 different situations–which is more than the number of atoms in the universe. And the game space keeps getting bigger as the stack sizes of the two competitors gets bigger.</p><p>But it is still possible for a computer to beat a human at calculating game theory optimal decisions–if you approach the problem correctly.</p><p>Libratus was developed by CMU professor Tuomas Sandholm, along with my guest today Noam Brown. The Libratus team taught their AI the rules of poker, they gave it a reward function (to win as much money as possible), and they told it to optimize that reward function. Then they had Libratus train itself with simulations.</p><p>After enough training, Libratus was ready to crush human competitors, which it did in hilarious, entertaining fashion. There is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLXPGwJNLHk">video from Engadget on YouTube</a> about the AI competing against professional humans.</p><p>In this episode, Noam Brown explains how they built Libratus, what it means for poker players, and what the implications are for humanity–if we can automate poker, what can’t we automate?</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>If you wanted to build a machine learning model to understand human health, where would you get the data? A hospital database would be useful, but privacy laws make it difficult to disclose that patient data to the public. In order to publicize the data safely, you would have to anonymize it, so that a patient’s identity could not be derived from data about that patient–and <a href="http://archive.wired.com/politics/security/commentary/securitymatters/2007/12/securitymatters_1213">true anonymization is notoriously difficult</a>.</p><p>In every industry where privacy is a concern there is a similar challenge. If there is no place with public data sets, there is no place where the machines can go to learn. The possible machine learning applications that we can build are limited by the data sets that are available.</p><p>Auren Hoffman started his company SafeGraph to unlock data sets so that machine learning algorithms can learn from that data.

There is not even a broad consensus on how we can define the term “intelligence”.</p><p>Information technology is improving so rapidly we are losing the ability to forecast the near future. Even the most well-informed politicians and business people are constantly surprised by technological changes, and the downstream impact on society. Today, the most accurate guidance on the pace of technology comes from the scientists and the engineers who are building the tools of our future.</p><p>Martin Ford is a computer engineer and the author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Architects-Intelligence-truth-people-building/dp/1789131510/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1548626153&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=architects+of+intelligence"><em>Architects of Intelligence</em>, a new book of interviews with the top researchers in artificial intelligence.</a> His interviewees include Jeff Dean, Andrew Ng, Demis Hassabis, Ian Goodfellow, and Ray Kurzweil.</p><p><em>Architects of Intelligence</em> is a privileged look at how AI is developing. Martin Ford surveys these different AI experts with similar questions. How will China’s adoption of AI differ from that of the US? What is the difference between the human brain and that of a computer? What are the low-hanging fruit applications of AI that we have yet to build?</p><p>Martin joins the show to talk about his new book. In our conversation, Martin synthesizes ideas from these different researchers, and describes the key areas of disagreement from across the field.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>There are two factors that limit the rate at which transactions are accepted into the Bitcoin blockchain: block time and block size. Block time defines how often a new block is appended onto the blockchain. Block size defines how many transactions fit into a new block.</p><p>As of March 2018, the current block time and block size allow for about 7 transactions per second to be accepted into the Bitcoin blockchain. In today’s episode, we discuss the technical limitations of the Bitcoin blockchain, and some potential solutions to scalability: SegWit and lightning network.</p><p>Today’s guest is Peter Ullrich, the host of Explain Blockchain. Explain Blockchain is a podcast I have found tremendously useful as I have started to learn about blockchains. He provides thorough, technical explanations of complicated topics, and I recommend subscribing to his show, and listening to the episodes multiple times, because there is a lot of content condensed into a short amount of time.</p><p>Over the next month, we will be exploring a variety of blockchain-based technologies. Some interviews will be high-level conversations that assume only a familiarity with cryptocurrencies. Some of them will be deeply technical, and assume a strong understanding of Bitcoin and Ethereum. And some episodes, like today’s episode, will be aimed at the developer who is in the process of “going down the rabbit hole.”</p><p>If you are looking for an internship, apply to the Software Engineering Daily internship, at <a href="https://softwaredaily.com/jobs">softwaredaily.com/jobs</a>. And if you are looking to recruit engineers, you can post jobs for your company there as well–it’s completely free to post jobs and to apply.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Malware is malicious software that makes money for the creator of that software. Malware can appear onto a user’s computer if that user visits a malicious website or installs malicious software by accident.</p><p>There are many types of malware. Spyware sits on your machine and logs your data in order to sell it. Ransomware can lock your computer and demand that you pay money to unlock it. Adware serves you popup ads that you don’t want to see.</p><p>Cryptojacking is a newer form of malware. Cryptojacking software uses your computer to mine Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Cryptojacking can occur when you visit a website that is running JavaScript that is executing along with the rest of the webpage. When you visit a website with a cryptojacker, your computer will become slower, because your CPU is being taken over to mine cryptocurrency.</p><p>Cryptojacking can occur anywhere that code runs–and there is a lot of code running on cloud providers.</p><p>Cloud providers themselves are very secure. But a cloud provider cannot force its customers to be secure. Users who host an insecure application on a cloud provider may get infected with a cryptojacker. If I host a large, complex website on a cloud provider, and I’m serving millions of users, I’m already paying a lot in cloud costs. But when my application gets infected with a cryptojacker, my costs could shoot up. And if I don’t know why my costs are increasing, I might leave the cloud provider.</p><p>Estaban Vargas is the co-founder of <a href="https://www.safetalpa.com/">SafeTalpa</a>, a company that provides defense against cryptojackers. Estaban joins the show to explain how cryptojackers work and why cloud providers have trouble defending against them.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>The volume of data in the world is always increasing. The costs of storing that data is always decreasing. And the means for processing that data is always evolving.</p><p>Sensors, cameras, and other small computers gather large quantities of data from the physical world around us. User analytics tools gather information about how we are interacting with the Internet. Logging servers collect terabytes of records about how our systems are performing.</p><p>From the popularity of MapReduce, to the rise of open source distributed processing frameworks like Spark and Flink, to the wide variety of cloud services like BigQuery: there is an endless set of choices for how to analyze gigantic sets of data. </p><p>Machine learning training and inference is another dimension of the modern data engineering stack. Whereas tools like Spark and BigQuery are great for performing ad-hoc queries, systems like TensorFlow are optimized for the model training and deployment process.</p><p>Stitching together these tools allows a developer to compose workflows for how data pipelines progress through a data engineering system. One popular tool for this is Apache Airflow, which was created in 2014 and is widely used at companies like Airbnb.</p><p>Over the next few years, we will see a proliferation of new tools in the world of data engineering–and for good reason. There is a wealth of opportunity for companies to leverage their data to make better decisions, and potentially to clean and offer their internal data as APIs and pre-trained machine learning models.</p><p>Today, there is a vast number of enterprises who are modernizing their software development process with Kubernetes, cloud providers, and continuous delivery. Eventually, these enterprises will improve their complex software architecture, and will move from a defensive position to an offensive one. These enterprises will shift their modernization efforts from “DevOps” to “<a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/10/18/dataops-and-the-data-platform/">DataOps</a>”, and thousands of software vendors will be ready to sell them new software for modernizing their data platform.</p><p>There is not a consensus for the best way to build and run a “data platform”. Nearly every company we have talked to on the show has a different definition and a different architecture for their “data platform”: <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/08/16/doordash-engineering-with-raghav-ramesh/">Doordash</a>, <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/06/18/dremio-data-engineering-with-tomer-shiran/">Dremio</a>, <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/09/28/prisma-graphql-infrastructure-with-soren-bramer-schmidt/">Prisma</a>, <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/05/24/ubers-data-platform-with-zhenxiao-luo/">Uber</a>, <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/tag/mapr/">MapR</a>, <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/10/15/data-warehouse-with-christian-kleinerman/">Snowflake</a>, <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2017/07/10/kafka-in-the-cloud-with-neha-narkhede/">Confluent</a>, <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/02/26/spark-and-streaming-with-matei-zaharia/">Databricks</a>…</p><p>We don’t expect to have a concise answer for how to run a data platform any time soon–but on the bright side, data infrastructure seems to be improving. Companies are increasingly able to ask questions about their data and get quick answers, in contrast to the data breadlines that were so prevalent five years ago. </p><p>Today we cover yet another approach to large scale data processing.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/grailbio/reflow">Reflow</a> is a system for incremental data processing in the cloud. Reflow includes a functional, domain specific language for writing workflow programs, a runtime for evaluating those programs incrementally, and a scheduler for dynamically provisioning resources for those workflows. Reflow was created for large bioinformatics workloads, but should be broadly applicable to scientific and engineering computing workloads.</p><p>Reflow  evaluates programs incrementally. Whenever the input data or the program changes, only the outputs that depend on the changes are recomputed. This minimizes the amount of recomputation that needs to be performed across a computational graph.</p><p>Marius Eriksen is the creator of Reflow and an engineer at GRAIL. He joins the show to discuss the motivation for a new data processing system–which involves explaining why workloads in bioinformatics are different than in some other domains.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Functions as a service are deployable functions that run without an addressable server.</p><p>Functions as a service scale without any work by the developer. When you deploy a function as a service to a cloud provider, the cloud provider will take care of running that function whenever it is called. </p><p>You don’t have to worry about spinning up a new machine and monitoring that machine, and spinning the machine down once it becomes idle. You just tell the cloud provider that you want to run a function, and the cloud provider executes it and returns the result.</p><p>Functions as a service can be more cost effective than running virtual machines or containerized infrastructure, because you are letting the cloud provider decide where to schedule your function, and you are giving the cloud provider flexibility on when to schedule the function.</p><p>The developer experience for deploying a serverless function can feel mysterious. You send a blob of code into the cloud. Later on, you send a request to call that code in the cloud. The result of the execution of that code gets sent back down to you. What is happening in between?</p><p>Rodric Rabbah is the principal researcher and technical lead in serverless computing at IBM. He helped design IBM Cloud Functions, the open source functions-as-a-service platform that IBM has deployed and operationalized as IBM Cloud Functions. Rodric joins the show to explain how to build a platform for functions as a service.</p><p>When a user deploys a function to IBM Cloud Functions, that function gets stored in a database as a blob of text, waiting to be called. When the user makes a call to the function, IBM Cloud Functions takes it from the database and queues the function in Kafka, and eventually schedules the function onto a container for execution. Once the function has executed, IBM Cloud Functions stores the result in a database and sends that result to the user.</p><p>When you execute a function, the time spent scheduling it and loading it onto a container is known as the “cold start problem”. The steps of executing a serverless function take time, but the resource savings are significant. Your code is just stored as a blob of text in a database, rather than sitting in memory on a server, waiting to execute. </p><p>In his research for building IBM Cloud Functions, Rodric wrote about some of the tradeoffs for users who build applications with serverless functions. The tradeoffs exist along what Rodric calls “the serverless trilemma.”</p><p>In today’s episode, we discuss why people are using functions-as-a-service, the architecture of IBM Cloud Functions, and the unsolved challenges of building a serverless platform.

When you hit a website, a variety of trackers are logging your data for the purpose of serving you better ads.</p><p>Some people don’t like ads, and they don’t like being tracked–but what is the alternative? How else can we get all the content we want? Since the 90’s, engineers have envisioned an Internet powered by micropayments. A micropayments system in your browser would allow users to pay for content with money instead of adtech.</p><p>Brave is a web browser built with a modern view of advertising, privacy, and economics.

    'Episodes Pubdate Date': '2018-01-08',
    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Docker was released in 2013, and popularized the use of containers. A container is an abstraction for isolating a well-defined portion of an operating system. Developers quickly latched onto containers as a way to cut down on the cost of virtual machines–as well as isolate code and simplify deployments. Developers began deploying so many containers that they needed a centralized way to manage the containers.     </p><p>Then came the rise of the container orchestration framework.</p><p>A container orchestration framework is used to manage operating system resources. Twitter had been using the open source orchestration framework Apache Mesos to manage resources since 2010. So when developers started looking for a way to manage containers, many of them chose Mesos. Meanwhile, another container orchestration system came onto the scene: Docker Swarm. Swarm is a tool for managing containers that came from the same people who originally created Docker. </p><p>Shortly thereafter, Kubernetes came out of Google. Google had been using containers internally with their cluster manager Borg. Kubernetes is a container orchestration system that was built with the lessons of managing resources at Google. </p><p>The reason I recount this history (as I have in a few past episodes) is to underscore that there was a few years where there was a lot of debate around the best container orchestration system to use. Some people preferred Swarm, some preferred Mesos, and some preferred Kubernetes. </p><p>Because of the lack of standardization, the community of developers who were building infrastructure in this space were put in a tough position: should you pick a specific orchestration framework, and go all in, building only tools for that one framework? Should you try to build tools to be compatible with all three frameworks, and attempt to satisfy Kubernetes, Mesos, and Swarm users? Or should you sit out altogether and build nothing?</p><p>The fracturing of the community led to healthy debates, but it slowed down innovation, because different developers were moving in different directions. Today, the container community has centralized: Kubernetes has become the most popular container orchestration framework. </p><p>With the community centralizing on Kubernetes, developers are able to comfortably bet big on open source projects like Istio, Conduit, Rook, Fluentd, and Helm, each of which we will be covering in the next few weeks. </p><p>The centralization on Kubernetes also makes it easier to build enterprise companies, who are no longer trying to think about which container orchestration to support. There is a wide array of Kubernetes-as-a-service providers offering a highly available runtime–and a variety of companies offering observability tools to make it easier to debug distributed systems problems.</p><p>Despite all of these advances–Kubernetes is less usable than it should be. It still feels like operating a distributed system. Hopefully someday, operating a Kubernetes cluster will be as easy as operating your laptop computer. To get there, we need improvements in Kubernetes usability.</p><p>Today’s guest Joe Beda was one of the original creators of the Kubernetes project. He is a founder of Heptio, a company that provides Kubernetes tools and services for enterprises. I caught up with Joe at KubeCon 2017, and he told me about where Kubernetes is today, where it is going, and what he is building at Heptio. Full disclosure–Heptio is a sponsor of Software Engineering Daily.</p><p>For the next two weeks, we are covering exclusively the world of Kubernetes. Kubernetes is a project that is likely to have as much impact as Linux. Whether you are an expert in Kubernetes or you are just starting out, we have lots of episodes to fit your learning curve.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>When software is performing suboptimally, the programmer can use a variety of tools to diagnose problems and improve the quality of the code. A profiler is a tool for examining where a program is spending time. </p><p>Every program consists of a set of different functions. These functions call each other. The total amount of time that your program runs is the sum of the time your program spends in all of the different functions. When you run a program, you can execute a profiler on that program, and the profiler will give you a breakdown of which of the different functions time is being spent in. </p><p>If you have function A, B, and C, your profiler might say that your program is spending 30% of its time in function A, 20% of its time in function B, and 50% of its time in function C.</p><p>Julia Evans is a software engineer at Stripe, and the creator of a Ruby profiler called rbspy. rbspy can execute on a running Ruby program and report back with a profile. As Julia explains, a profiler turns out to be a non-trivial piece of software to build. To introspect a Ruby program, you need to understand how the Ruby interpreter is translating Ruby code into C structs for execution.</p><p>This episode is about profilers–but in order to talk about profilers, we also have to talk about Ruby, the Ruby interpreter, and the way that executing programs are laid out in memory.</p><p>Transcript provided by We Edit Podcasts.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>It’s 9pm at night, and you are hungry. You order a pizza from Domino’s. You live on a street that’s dark, and so you have installed a smart lightbulb in front of your mailbox that lights up the address. When the pizza at Domino’s is ready, you want the lightbulb on your mailbox to light up so that the delivery person can read your address when they arrive in front of your house with the pizza.</p><p>The Internet should make it possible to have this kind of event-driven, connected world. Anything that is connected to the Internet should be able to send signals to anything else on the Internet, so that our lives gradually become more automated.</p><p>This is what IFTTT does. Users of IFTTT can easily create applets to wire different services together. You can use IFTTT to trigger an email whenever three of your friends retweet something on Twitter. You can use IFTTT to flash the lights in your house when Bitcoin hits new market highs. You can use IFTTT to order a pizza whenever Bitcoin crashes.</p><p>IFTTT makes it easy to connect different services together, and a lot of work goes into the infrastructure that enables these billions of events to process correctly. Nicky Leach from IFTTT’s engineering team joins the show to describe how IFTTT allows for integrations between services that were not built to integrate–and he talks about the scheduling, data engineering, and monitoring of the company’s software stack.</p><p>Transcript provided by We Edit Podcasts.

When we specify that we want certain information hidden, for example our phone number or our date of birth, we expect the system to hide the information. However, this doesn’t always happen due to human error in the code because programmers have to write checks and filters across the program. </p><p>In this episode, Edaena Salinas interviews Jean Yang, Assistant Professor at the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon, who presents Jeeves, a language that allows programmers to specify security policies more intuitively, making it harder to leak information that is meant to be protected. Jean explained how Jeeves was implemented and how it can be used. We also talked about what it takes to bring research concepts from academia to the industry and at the end we had a very interesting conversation on how to educate a broader audience on the importance of security. Jean was also named one of the 35 innovators under 35 by MIT Technology Review.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Serverless computing is a technique for deploying applications without an addressable server.</p><p>A serverless application is running on servers, but the developer does not have access to the server in the traditional sense. The developer is not dealing with IP addresses and configuring instances of their different services to be able to scale.</p><p>Just as higher level languages like C abstracted away the necessity of a developer to work with assembly code, serverless computing gives a developer more leverage by letting them focus on business logic while a serverless platform takes care of deployment, uptime, autoscaling, and other aspects of cloud computing that are fundamental to every application.</p><p>“Serverless” can several different things: <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2017/05/17/firebase-with-doug-stevenson/">backend-as-a-service products like Firebase</a>, <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/10/30/serverless-backend-using-aws-lambda-hands-on-guide/">functions-as-a-service like AWS Lambda</a>, and <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2017/01/31/twilio-engineering-with-pat-malatack/">high-level APIs such as Twilio</a>.</p><p>Zeit is a deployment platform built for serverless development. In Zeit, users model a GitHub repository in terms of the functions within their application. Zeit deploys the code from those functions onto functions-as-a-service and allows you to run your code across all the major cloud providers.</p><p>Guillermo Rauch is the founder of Zeit, and he joins the show to discuss his vision for the company and the platform as it looks today. <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2016/03/03/socket-io-and-realtime-applications-with-guillermo-rauch/">Guillermo was previously on the show to discuss Socket.io</a>, which he created.</p>',

But EC2 is a large abstraction compared to what many people need for their nodes–which is a container with a smaller set of resources to work with. Containers can be run within a managed cluster like ECS or EKS, or run on their own as AWS Fargate instances, or simply as Docker containers running without a container orchestration tool.</p><p>Beyond the option of explicit container instances, users can run their application as a “serverless” function-as-a-service such as AWS Lambda. Functions-as-a-service abstract away the container and let the developer operate at a higher level, while also providing some cost savings.</p><p>Developers use these different compute options for different reasons. Deepak Singh is the director of compute services at Amazon Web Services, and he joins the show to discuss the use cases and tradeoffs of these options.</p><p>Deepak also discusses how these tools are useful internally to AWS.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Modern software consists of sprawling international networks of servers. </p><p>Users contact these servers to access applications. Microservices talk to each other to fulfill complicated requests. Databases and machine learning frameworks crunch terabytes of information to provide complicated answers. Across this infrastructure, there is a lot of different activities–and a lot of vulnerabilities. Without a reliable model for security and trust, software can be easily compromised.</p><p>In the past, systems were often protected by a “firewall”, which is a security system around the perimeter of the network. A problem with this model is that if the attacker is able to penetrate the firewall, they can compromise anywhere in the network. Firewalls can be penetrated, so a much better security model is to assume that your network has already been compromised, and to require every internal system to identify and authenticate with each other.</p><p>“Zero-trust security” is a security model that requires internal systems to communicate with each other as if they were potentially compromised. Evan Gilman is the author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zero-Trust-Networks-Building-Untrusted/dp/1491962194">Zero Trust Networks: Building Secure Systems in Untrusted Networks</a>. He also works on SPIFFE, a system for managing identity and trust within a zero-trust network.</p><p>In a previous episode about <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/02/09/google-beyondcorp-with-max-saltonstall/">Google BeyondCorp</a>, Max Saltonstall talked about zero-trust networking in the context of user and device authentication. In today’s episode, Evan discusses another side of zero-trust networking: workload identity and authentication. Just as Google BeyondCorp outlines an architecture for allowing devices to communicate with the network, the SPIFFE project outlines a system for workloads to identify and authenticate themselves. Workloads can range from MapReduce jobs to microservices to frontend application servers.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Streaming architecture defines how large volumes of data make their way through an organization. Data is created at a user’s smartphone, or on a sensor inside of a conveyor belt at a factory. That data is sent to a set of backend services that aggregate the data, organizing it and making it available to business analysts, application developers, and machine learning algorithms.</p><p>The velocity at which data is created has led to widespread use of the “stream” abstraction–a never ending, append-only array of data. To deal with this volume, streams need to be buffered, batched, cached, mapreduced, machine learned, and munged until they are in a state where they can provide value to the end user.</p><p>There are numerous ways that data can travel this path, and in today’s episode we discuss the streaming systems, data lakes, and data warehouses that can be used to build an architecture that makes use of streaming data. Ted Dunning is a chief application architect at MapR, and he joins the show to discuss the patterns that engineering teams are using to build modern streaming architectures. Full disclosure: MapR is a sponsor of Software Engineering Daily.</p><p>Meetups for Software Engineering Daily are being planned! Go to softwareengineeringdaily.com/meetup if you want to register for an upcoming Meetup. In March, I’ll be visiting Datadog in New York and Hubspot in Boston, and in April I’ll be at Telesign in LA.</p><p>Summer internship applications to Software Engineering Daily are also being accepted.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Facebook generates high volumes of data at a rapid pace.</p><p>Dhruba Borthakur joined Facebook in 2008 to work on data infrastructure. His early projects at Facebook were around Hadoop, the distributed file system and MapReduce computation platform that laid the foundation for the “big data” movement. </p><p>At the time, Facebook was generating as much data as any other startup, and the company needed to stay at the leading edge of scalability techniques for its Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) cluster. </p><p>Traditionally, Hadoop managed its file system by synchronizing the coordination of the different data nodes with the help of a single master node. At Facebook, the scale of the data was such that the HDFS cluster had thousands of data nodes, which was too much volume for a single master node to handle. Dhruba helped implement redundancy at the master node to create a more resilient system.</p><p>The early days of the big data movement was focused on batch processing. A company like Facebook would gather large amounts of data into databases and HDFS, and run offline analytics workloads to gather reports on an hourly, daily, or weekly basis.</p><p>Over time, data infrastructure has moved closer to a “real time” processing model. Data infrastructure does not only support batch offline reporting–it also supports machine learning jobs that need to be run on a more frequent basis. These jobs have lower latency requirements, and have driven the adoption of in-memory stream processing systems like Spark and Flink.</p><p>Dhruba joins the show to discuss his time at Facebook building data infrastructure. He takes us through the major projects he worked on, including the early Hadoop infrastructure, the refactoring of online user workloads to be more “pull” based than “push” based, and the creation of RocksDB, a storage engine he helped create at Facebook.</p><p>Today, Dhruba is the CTO and co-founder of Rockset, a company that builds data infrastructure and database APIs on top of RocksDB. Rockset is building infrastructure for modern technology companies–many of which are facing problems that bear significant resemblance to the ones Facebook encountered as it scaled.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Starting an Internet business is harder than it should be. You need to incorporate, create an operating agreement, set up a system to accept payments, and many other straightforward tasks. </p><p>In the 1990s, this was how it felt to set up anything on the Internet. You always had to stand up a web server on your own infrastructure, before you could get to the interesting part–which was building an actual product. With the popularization of cloud computing, it became massively easier to stand up a server. Because of that lower activation energy, millions of applications and thousands of software businesses got started.</p><p>But the activation energy required to start a business remains higher than necessary. It feels like standing up a web server in the 90s–lots of tedium and reinventing the wheel that has been done by people before you. This is the motivation behind Stripe Atlas, a project to simplify the process of starting an Internet business.</p><p>Patrick McKenzie works on Atlas at Stripe. He was previously on the show to discuss his experience leaving a large corporation to work on his own small software companies. And his name has become synonymous with the modern phenomenon of the small software company–he has been writing about this topic for over a decade at <a href="http://kalzumeus.com">Kalzumeus.com</a>.</p><p>It was great to talk to Patrick once again about Internet businesses, and I’m excited to see Stripe Atlas become something huge.</p><p>Transcript provided by We Edit Podcasts.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Since Kubernetes came out, engineers have been deploying clusters to Amazon. In the early years of Kubernetes, deploying to AWS meant that you had to manage the availability of the cluster yourself. You needed to configure etcd and your master nodes in a way that avoided having a single point of failure. </p><p>Deploying Kubernetes on AWS became simpler with an open-source tool called kops (short for Kubernetes Operations). Kops automates the provisioning and high-availability deployment of Kubernetes.</p><p>In late 2017, AWS released a managed Kubernetes service called EKS. EKS allows developers to run Kubernetes without having to manage the availability and scaling of a cluster. The announcement of EKS was exciting, because it means that all of the major cloud providers are officially supporting Kubernetes.</p><p>Arun Gupta is a principal open source technologist at AWS, and he joins the show to explain what is involved in deploying and managing a Kubernetes cluster. Arun describes how to operate a Kubernetes cluster, including logging, monitoring, storage, and updates. If you are convinced that you want to use Kubernetes, but you aren’t sure yet how you want to deploy it, this will be useful information for you.</p><p>We also discussed how Amazon built EKS, and some of the architectural decisions they made. AWS has had a managed container service called ECS since 2014. The development of ECS was instructive for the AWS engineers who built EKS. Amazon wanted to make EKS able to integrate with both open source tools and the Amazon managed services.</p><p>Transcript provided by We Edit Podcasts.

Paul had studied computer science, and was able to use his knowledge of high-performance computing to write an efficient graph database, and solve the other technical puzzles that the company faced–but the business did not ultimately work out.</p><p>The failure of Tribe made the founders even hungrier for success–and it taught them lessons that they carried into subsequent businesses.</p><p>Paul went on to start Aggregate Knowledge, a marketing technology company that sold for $119 million. His Tribe co-founder Mark Pincus went on to start Zynga, the multi-billion dollar gaming company. Another Tribe employee co-founded Yammer, which sold to Microsoft for a billion dollars.</p><p>Since his exit from Aggregate Knowledge, Paul Martino started Bullpen Capital, which makes post-seed investments. The Bullpen Capital portfolio is appealing to me–partly because of the number of Internet gambling companies. Paul and I talked about gambling and other taboo business sectors–as well as what makes a good investment in the “post-seed” category. </p><p>I enjoyed speaking to Paul because he has a straightforward, no-nonsense way of talking about things–it’s very charismatic and uncommon.</p><p>We have done some great shows with other engineering investors like Chris Dixon and Adrian Colyer.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Self-driving transportation will be widely deployed at some point in the future. How far off is that future? There are widely varying estimations: maybe you will summon a self-driving Uber in a New York within 5 years, or maybe it will take 20 years to work out all of the challenges in legal and engineering.</p><p>Between now and the self-driving future, there will be a long span of time where cars are semi-autonomous. Maybe your car is allowed to drive itself in certain areas of the city. Maybe your car can theoretically drive itself in 99% of conditions, but the law requires you to be behind the wheel until the algorithms get just a little bit better.</p><p>While we wait for self-driving to be widely deployed to consumers, a lot could change in the market. We know about Uber, Lyft, Waymo, Tesla and Cruise. But what about the classic car companies like Ford, Mercedes Benz, and Volkswagen? These companies are great at making cars, and they have hired teams of engineers working on self-driving. </p><p>But self-driving functionality is not the only piece of software you need to compete as a transportation company. You also need to build a marketplace for your autonomous vehicles, because in the future, far fewer people will want to own a car. Customers will want to use transportation as a service.</p><p>RideOS is a company that is building fleet management and navigation software. If you run a company that is building autonomous cars, you need to solve the problem of making an autonomous, safe robot that can drive you around. </p><p>Building an autonomous car is hard, but to go to market as a next-generation transportation company, you also need fleet management software, so you can deploy your cars in an Uber-like transportation system. And you need navigation software so that your cars know how to drive around.</p><p>RideOS lets a car company like Ford focus on building cars by providing a set of SDKs and cloud services for managing and navigating fleets of cars. Rohan Paranjpe joins today’s show to talk about the world of self-driving cars. Rohan worked at Tesla and Uber before joining RideOS, so he has a well-informed perspective on a few directions the self-driving car market might go in.</p>',

Giant technology companies are the casino owners, online publishers are the casino employees, the brand advertisers are the victims who keep returning to the casino to lose their money, and the small adtech companies are the sharks who make lots of money exploiting the inefficiencies of the system.</p><p>One of these smaller adtech companies is called eZanga. eZanga sells “pre-filtered traffic.” Pre-filtered traffic means traffic that will pass through bot detection filters. A publisher  can purchase traffic to their website so that the ads on that website get viewed.</p><p>eZanga describes this technology as “marketing,” and has won a giant contract with United States government to handle advertising for the GSA. Advertising fraud does not just promote misinformation–it is now taking our tax dollars and spending it on paid traffic.</p><p>If any of this is confusing to you, don’t worry. We explain it all in today’s episode with Shailin Dhar, the advertising fraud expert who wrote a detailed report about eZanga and its contract with the US Government. Shailin was previously on the show to give an overview of ad fraud, and what his work as an ad fraud investigator entails.</p><p>Also, Shailin will be a speaker at our third Meetup, Wednesday May 3rd at Galvanize in San Francisco.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Every company with a large set of customers has a large set of data–whether that company is 5 years old or 50 years old. That data is valuable whether you are an insurance company, a soft drink manufacturer, or a ridesharing company. All of these large companies know that their data is valuable, but some of them are not sure how to standardize the access patterns of that data, or build a culture around data.</p><p>The larger the company is, the more the data is spread throughout the company, and the more heterogeneous the data sources are. Older companies often have older pieces of data infrastructure, and it might not be well documented.</p><p>It is hard to make data driven decisions when an organization cannot effectively query their own data. For example, consider a simple question about marketing. An insurance company wants to know how their spending on TV advertising correlates with sales in California over the last 25 years. </p><p>The VP of marketing sends an email to a business analyst, asking for a historical report of this marketing data. The business analyst knows how to present the data with a business intelligence tool, but the analyst needs to ask the data scientist for how to make that query. The data scientist needs to ask the data engineer where to find those records in a large Hadoop distributed file system cluster. And the data engineer joined the company last week and has no idea where anything is.</p><p>These are the problems of DataOps. Similarly to DevOps, DataOps is the recognition that a set of problems have crept into organizations over time and slowed down productivity. </p><p>The story of the DevOps movement is that old infrastructure, lack of testing, and complicated monolithic backends slowed down everyone in an old, big enterprise. The slow pace of change destroys morale and erodes trust. The DevOps movement is about revamping organizations through tooling and organizational behavior. <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2016/10/13/devops-handbook-with-gene-kim/">We have covered this in lots of episodes, such as in a great episode with Gene Kim who wrote “The Phoenix Project.”</a></p><p>When an organization wants to reinvent itself with DevOps, it often begins with testing and continuous delivery. DataOps encourages data driven organizations to begin with a similar practice of testing their data pipelines to build trust and evolve best practices. There are other similarities between DataOps and DevOps, such as continuous delivery and the breaking down of siloes between different organizational roles.</p><p>Chris Bergh joins the show to talk about the data problems encountered by large companies, the practices of DataOps, and his company Data Kitchen, which builds tools to help companies move towards more productive data practices.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Amazon Web Services changed how software engineers work. Before AWS, it was common for startups to purchase their own physical servers. AWS made server resources as accessible as an API request, and has gone on to create higher-level abstractions for building applications.</p><p>For the first few years of AWS, the abstractions were familiar. S3 provided distributed, reliable object storage. Elastic MapReduce provided a managed Hadoop system. Kinesis provided a scalable queue. Amazon provided developers with managed alternatives to complicated open source software.</p><p>More recently, AWS has started to release products that are unlike anything else. A perfect example is AWS Lambda, the first function-as-a-service platform. Other newer AWS products include Ground Station, a service for processing satellite data and AWS DeepRacer, a miniature race car for developers to build and test machine learning algorithms on.</p><p>As AWS has grown into new categories, the blog announcements of new services and features have started coming so frequently that it is hard to keep track of it all. Corey Quinn is the author of “<a href="https://lastweekinaws.com/">Last Week in AWS</a>”, a popular newsletter about what is changing across Amazon Web Services.</p><p>Corey joins the show to give his perspective on the growing, shifting behemoth that is Amazon Web Services–as well as the other major cloud providers that have risen to prominence.

As TIBCO grew in popularity, the company expanded into other areas through products it developed in-house as well as through acquisitions.</p><p>One acquisition was Jaspersoft, a business intelligence data platform. When TIBCO acquired Jaspersoft in 2014, the architecture was a monolithic Java application. Around this time, customer use cases were shifting from centralized reporting to real-time, embedded visualizations. </p><p>The use case of the Jaspersoft software was becoming less centralized and less monolithic and the software architecture needed to change in order to reflect that.</p><p>Jan Schiffman is a VP of engineering at TIBCO and Sherman Wood is a director at TIBCO. They join the show to discuss the process of migrating a large Java monolith to a composable set of services. Breaking up a monolith is not an easy process–nor is it something that every company should do just because they have a monolith. In some cases, a monolith is just fine.</p><p>Jan and Sherman explain why the business use case for why the Jaspersoft monolith needed to be refactored, and their approach to the refactoring. We also talk through the modern use cases of embedded analytics and the interaction between business analysts and data engineers. At a higher level, we discuss the lessons they have learned from managing a large, complex refactoring. Full disclosure: TIBCO is a sponsor of Software Engineering Daily.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Music collaboration has historically been accomplished by musicians gathering in bands. A band is usually an in-person, physical manifestation: a drummer, a guitarist, a piano player. Or, on a large scale, a symphony of classical instruments led by a conductor. Today, the most flexible instrument that anyone can play is arguably the computer, because a computer can simulate or replay any of the sounds made by any other instrument. </p><p>Another advantage of the computer is that it removes physicality as a constraint on the musician. A computer musician does not have to train their muscles to play piano, or guitar, or drums. The computer musician can imagine a sound and bring it to life inside a digital audio workstation (a program for composing and arranging music).</p><p>The rise of the computer musician has coincided with a change in the way popular music is created. Instead of bands needing to work together to create a piece of music, a single producer can simulate all of the members of the band by programming piano, drums, and everything else.</p><p>The rise of the solo producer has given birth to new kinds of music–but solo music production inherently limits the range of musical ideas that can be explored. The most important works of art have input from multiple people. And even the most successful solo producers love to work with other artists who have a complementary skill–such as vocals.</p><p>For the last twenty years, the model of solo producer working with pop vocalist has largely dominated the charts. Musical collaboration has stuck to a model that mimics its pre-Internet form, with very small groups of 1-5 people making the core of a song. The main tools that people use to collaborate are email and Dropbox.</p><p>Splice is a tool for music collaboration. Splice combines version control, revision history, social networking, sample discovery, synthesizer rental, and other features. Splice is changing the way that music is created, with a large percentage of top producers adopting it. The impact Splice has on music will be on par with what Github has done for software engineering.</p><p>Matt Aimonetti is the CTO and co-founder of Splice, and he joins the show to talk about the founding story, the product development, and the engineering of Splice.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Data infrastructure is advancing beyond the days of Hadoop MapReduce, single-node databases, and nightly reporting.</p><p>Companies are adopting modern data warehouses, streaming data systems, and cloud-specific data tools like BigQuery. Every company with a large amount of data wants to aggregate that data into a data lake and make the data available to developers. All of this data can be used to power machine learning models which can potentially improve every area within a company where they have historical data.</p><p>“Data pipeline” is a term used to describe the process of preparing data, building machine learning models, deploying those models, and tracking the results of those models.</p><p>Pachyderm is a company and open source project that is focused on deployment, management, and scalability of data pipelines. Pachyderm allows developers to version data, track the state of data sets, backtest machine learning models, and collaborate on data. It also tackles the very hard problem of machine learning auditability.</p><p>Joe Doliner is the CEO of Pachyderm and joins the show to discuss his experience building Pachyderm over the last five years. Data infrastructure has changed a lot in five years, and the world has moved in a direction that has benefitted Pachyderm, with more infrastructure moving to containers and more data teams advancing beyond a world of just Hadoop MapReduce.</p><p>In today’s show, Joe talks about modern infrastructure, data provenance, and the long-term vision of Pachyderm.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Linux has created much more value for Google than it has for Linus Torvalds. Ruby on Rails has created more value for Airbnb than it has for David Heinemeier Hansson. Successful open source projects create more value than their creators’ capture–and that’s one reason why collections of people on the Internet are often inspired to work together on open source.</p><p>When an engineer creates an open source project, and that open source project finds a large audience, that engineer can often build a successful business. SpringSource, Cloudera, and Elastic are examples of massively successful enterprises that were founded by the creators of open source software. But in other cases, the value of an open source project gets largely captured by cloud providers that create a closed source version of the open source project and offer it as a service.</p><p>Shaun Connolly has worked in senior strategic roles at software companies such as SpringSource, VMWare, and Hortonworks. Throughout his decades of experience, much of his time has been spent figuring out how to monetize open source projects intelligently. Shaun joins the show to talk about his past experiences building enterprises, as well as modern issues–such as how to compete with major cloud providers. We also discuss the Commons Clause license, a new software license that open source projects can use to try to protect their value from being entirely captured by a cloud provider.</p><p>Software Engineering Daily is looking for sponsors. If you are interested in reaching over 50,000 developers, you can go to softwareengineeringdaily.com/sponsor to find out more, and you can send us a message. We’d love to hear from you. And if you are an engineer working at a company that is marketing to developers, or hiring developers, if you tell your marketing department or your recruiting department about softwareengineeringdaily.com/sponsor, that is one way to help us out.</p>',

Around that time, companies were looking for solutions to both their online transactional workloads and their large-scale offline analytics workloads. Citus Data built its company around Postgres, a popular database that has been around since 1996. Products from Citus Data include a Postgres scalability extension as well as a cloud-hosted offering for spinning up Postgres instances.</p><p>Citus Data was acquired by Microsoft earlier this year. In today’s episode, Umur Cubukcu joins the show to talk about the story of the company from its early days to its eventual acquisition. Umur describes the landscape of data systems in 2011 when the company started, and explains how that evolved to the current ecosystem.

Rasa was started in 2015, amidst the chatbot fever. </p><p>Since then, Rasa has developed a system that allows a chatbot developer to train their bot through a system called interactive learning.

Serverless applications are composed of stateless functions-as-a-service and stateful data storage systems such as Redis or DynamoDB. </p><p>Serverless applications allow for scaling up and down the entire architecture, because each component is naturally scalable. And this pattern can be used to create a wide variety of applications. The functions-as-a-service can handle the compute logic, and the data storage systems can handle the storage. But these applications do not give the developer as much flexibility as an ideal serverless system might. The developer would need to use cloud-specific state management systems.</p><p>Vikram Sreekanti is the creator of Cloudburst, a system for stateful functions as a service. Cloudburst is architected as a set of VMs that can execute functions-as-a-service that are scheduled onto them.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>The container orchestration wars ended in 2016 with Kubernetes being the most popular open source tool for deploying and managing infrastructure. Since that time, most large enterprises have been implementing a “platform strategy” based around Kubernetes.</p><p>A platform strategy is a plan for creating a consistent experience for software engineers working throughout an enterprise. At most companies, a software engineer should be thinking about business logic–whether that logic is related to banking, insurance, oil and gas, or e-commerce. </p><p>Today, engineers at many enterprises need to think about continuous delivery, application deployment, security policy management, and other deeply technical problems that have nothing to do with the business that they are actually working at. Kubernetes is a foundational open source building block that allows enterprises to base the rest of their infrastructure decisions around. Kubernetes has made it much more viable for enterprises to pursue a platform strategy.</p><p>With widespread adoption of Kubernetes, there is a business opportunity for companies that can offer other platform solutions that build on top of Kubernetes. A service mesh is one such tool. A service mesh provides networking and security features for all the services in an organization.</p><p>The service mesh category is a large business opportunity because it sits on the critical path of every network request that goes through an enterprise. It is a potential insertion point for lots of other products including logging agents, distributed tracing, network packet scanning, security policy management, and A/B testing.</p><p>The potential for business expansion is why so many businesses are entering the service mesh category today, from cloud providers to API gateways. Buoyant was one of the first companies to work on a service mesh tool, with the Linkerd open source project. William Morgan is the CEO of Buoyant, and he returns to the show to discuss the competitive dynamics of the service mesh market.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Virtual machines were the unit of cloud computation for many years. Amazon Web Services pioneered the democratized model of allowing anyone to deploy a service to the cloud, running on a virtual machine on Amazon’s servers. After virtual machines, containers have become the unit of scale in the cloud. We break up our virtualized servers into even smaller units of computation called containers. Today, the unit of compute is getting reduced even more, with the introduction of serverless architecture.</p><p>Serverless architectures started getting talked about after Amazon Web Services released a service called AWS Lambda, which allows users to have pieces of code run in response to events. Programmers write a function and hand it off to Amazon, and Amazon will run that function call, and only charge the programmer when the function is actually called. This is in contrast to the cost model of containers or virtual machines, which users pay for even while they are running idle.</p><p>Today’s guest Austen Collins believes that serverless computing is the model of the future, and he created a company called Serverless around this idea. His company Serverless provides an application framework for building applications exclusively on Amazon Web Services Lambda.</p>',

But many of the data sources that a company needs to query in modern infrastructure are not databases–they are APIs like Salesforce, Zendesk, and Stripe. These API companies might store a large percentage of the data that a given company needs to query, and executing queries, subscriptions, and joins against these APIs is not a simple task.</p><p>OneGraph is a company that builds integrations with third-party services and exposes them through a GraphQL interface.

These frameworks often require the application developer to write imperative logic describing how that data should be processed. </p><p>For example, a high volume of clickstream data that is getting buffered to Kafka needs to have a stream processing system evaluate that data to prepare it for a data warehouse, Spark, or some other queryable environment. In practice, many developers simply want to have the high volume of data become queryable in the fewest number of steps possible.</p><p>Materialize is a streaming SQL materialized view engine that provides materialized views over streaming data. The materialized views are incrementally updated over time and reconciled with new data that may have come in out of order.</p><p>Arjun Narayan and Frank McSherry are the co-founders of Materialize, a company whose technology is based on the Naiad paper, which was written at Microsoft Research.

Every employee within Facebook can articulate the vision for the company, and will use similar language in describing that vision. </p><p>Since the employees are aligned on strategy, they can also align in their implementation of product features. This reduces conflicts across roles and between teams. </p><p>Facebook has also shown a willingness to trust its engineers.

As a daily software podcaster, I think I am as well positioned as anyone to be tuned into the breadth of the software engineering ecosystem–but I am constantly behind as well.</p><p>In his blog post “<a href="http://www.bennorthrop.com/Essays/2016/reflections-of-an-old-programmer.php">Reflections of an Old Programmer</a>”, Ben theorized about the causes of this feeling of fatigue, and the constant struggle to keep up with the world of software engineering. His post contains enduring lessons that will be of value to new programmers and will feel familiar to programmers who have been around for awhile.</p>',

Spot instances are cheap, spare compute capacity with lower reliability, that is available across AWS infrastructure. Reserved instances allow a developer to purchase longer term VM contracts for a lower price.</p><p>Reserved instances can provide significant savings, but it can be difficult to calculate how much infrastructure to purchase.

As a consequence, recidivism is the norm – according to a 2012 report by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, just over 65% of those released from California’s prison system return within three years. San Quentin State Prison in California is challenging this issue by trying to equip inmates with valuable skills while they are incarcerated.</p><p>The Last Mile is a program that works with prisoners to help them build relevant skills in technology so that they can more easily transition to productive employment once they are out of prison. Specifically, it teaches inmates how to program, oftentimes starting at the basics like how to use a computer, and how hypertext works. In addition to the challenges of teaching students who may not know computer basics, the program has to work with the constraint of not having internet access. In this episode, Wes and Jeff discuss the realities of incarceration in the United States, and how teaching inmates how to code is a remarkably empowering way to combat and weaken the prison-industrial complex.</p><p>Wes Bailey is the Director of Program Operations at The Last Mile, and a self-taught developer.</p>',

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Software engineering is a new field. There are theories about how we should be building our systems, but these theories might change over time. The same is true for engineering management. </p><p>There are many successful examples of companies scaling with the management hierarchies pioneered by Microsoft and Google, but since everyone knows that those techniques work, they get continually copied. Of course, there is tremendous risk in pioneering a brand new management structure. There have been examples of successful software companies that have suffered tremendously due to a trial of an exciting new management structure.</p><p>New software is much easier and safer to try than revolutionary new management structures. New software is easier to try in a company with a strong engineering team, because that team is equipped to assess the new software and figure out if it is actually solving a problem that the company has. </p><p>Uma Chingunde is an engineering manager at Stripe on the compute team. Uma has worked in management for a decade, and has worked in virtualization in infrastructure for even longer than that. Uma joins the show to give her perspective on management of engineers as well as management of compute infrastructure. We discussed some timeless principles of engineering management, as well as contemporary ideas around virtualization and compute.</p>',

The user initiates the ride, and the ride might last for an hour. At the end of the ride, the user is charged for the ride and sent a transactional email.</p><p>Throughout this entire ride, there are many different services and database tables being accessed across the Uber infrastructure. The transactions across this infrastructure need to be processed despite server failures which may occur along the way. </p><p>Workflows are not just a part of Uber. Many different types of distributed operations at a company might be classified as a workflow: banking operations, spinning up a large cluster of machines, performing a distributed cron job.</p><p>Maxim Fateev is the founder of Temporal.io, and the co-creator of Cadence, a workflow orchestration engine. Maxim developed Cadence when he was at Uber, seeing the engineering challenges that come from trying to solve the workflow orchestration problem.

    'Episodes Summary': '<p>Machine learning algorithms have existed for decades. But in the last ten years, several advancements in software and hardware have caused dramatic growth in the viability of applications based on machine learning.</p><p>Smartphones generate large quantities of data about how humans move through the world. Software-as-a-service companies generate data about how these humans interact with businesses. Cheap cloud infrastructure allows for the storage of these high volumes of data. Machine learning frameworks such as Apache Spark, TensorFlow, and PyTorch allow developers to easily train statistical models.</p><p>These models are deployed back to the smartphones and the software-as-a-service companies, which improves the ability for humans to move through the world and gain utility from their business transactions. And as the humans interact more with their computers, it generates more data, which is used to create better models, and higher consumer utility.</p><p>The combination of smartphones, cloud computing, machine learning algorithms, and distributed computing frameworks is often referred to as “artificial intelligence.” Chris Benson is the host of <a href="https://changelog.com/practicalai">the podcast Practical AI</a>, and he joins the show to talk about the modern applications of artificial intelligence, and the stories he is covering on Practical AI. On his podcast, Chris talks about everything within the umbrella of AI, from high level stories to low level implementation details.</p>',

Labeled examples are analyzed to understand the mathematical correlations between those labels. The more labeled training examples there are, the more accurate the correlations will be. </p><p>Today, we have high quality frameworks for writing the models. We have cheap cloud computing for training and deploying the models. The biggest factor that is preventing a wide variety of potential machine learning applications from existing is lack of access to large, labeled data sets.</p><p>Scale gives developers an API for labeling images, sound, natural language, and video. Scale is used by self-driving car companies, Airbnb, OpenAI, retailers, and robotics companies. The product is used broadly and at high volume. Scale was started only three years ago, and recently raised $100m at a valuation above $1b, making it one of the fastest growing software companies in history.</p><p>Alexandr Wang joins the show to discuss how Scale works, the future of machine learning, and the future of work.
